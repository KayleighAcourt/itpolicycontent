You must not:

*   Use email or the public folders via the internal bulletin boards to conduct trivial debates or exchanges with an individual or group of individuals.
*   Use the ZZ mail groups for anything other than appropriate business purposes. For personal matters, staff should use the bulletin board folders in Microsoft outlook.
*   Circulate messages or material that contains obscene, profane, inflammatory, threatening, harassing (racially, sexually or otherwise), and disruptive, or otherwise offensive language.
*   Make statements that defame, slander or lower the reputation of the Department, any person or organisation.
*   Forward e-mail chain letters to your e-mail contacts (you must report these to IT security branch).

You should guard against excessive use of e-mail (and in particular the inclusion of unsuitable attachments, ie video clips, images, executable files and/or sending to large numbers of recipients), which can affect the efficiency of the network system as a whole. For further information ask your manager or your local IT officer.

The Department will monitor the use of electronic communications and web-browsing. Your manager can request reports detailing your activity if they suspect inappropriate use of email or web-browsing facilities.
