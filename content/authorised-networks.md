## The role and function of the Government Secure Intranet (GSI)

The GSI allows connections to take place between its members, usually Government departments to each other via a common backbone and provides access to the internet and other external networks. It provides facilities similar to those being used by many commercial organisations, for example:

*   exchange of electronic mail between the internal networks of individual Government departments
*   exchange of electronic mail between Government departments and businesses or individual citizens connected to the Internet and other electronic services
*   access to the internet from browsers running on client machines in Government departments
*   access to internal (Government only) web pages from browsers in Government departments, ie intranet facilities

### Your information and IT security responsibilities

The GSI is secure for handling information within the OFFICIAL tier. Users of the GSI must possess basic check clearance or an acceptable Government equivalent.  
Whenever possible the GSI should be used for sending emails and always if the material contains personal data or is marked OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE. Exceptions may be allowed under established local procedures or must be approved by your manager or the information asset owner for material marked OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE.  

More information can be found in Chapter 7 of the MOJ ICT Security Guide.
