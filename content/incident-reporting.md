## Why?

All actual or suspected ICT security incidents must be reported immediately. Where an incident involves the loss of any data (including personal data), it must also be reported to the MoJ Data Access and Compliance Unit (DACU).

The ability of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to react quickly to IT Disaster Recovery events will ensure that losses are minimised and the business will be able to resume or continue operations as quickly as possible.

ITDR management is the ability to react to ITDR events in a controlled, pre-planned manner. Preparation and planning are key factors to successful incident management and all MoJ systems will rely upon the development and implementation of an ITDR plan as described in the main policy document
