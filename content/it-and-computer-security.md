MOJ and its information systems and networks are faced with security threats from a wide range of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, sabotage, vandalism, fire and flood. Sources of damage such as computer viruses, computer hacking and denial of service attacks have become more common, more ambitious and increasingly sophisticated.

The department’s dependence on its information systems and services means that it is more vulnerable to security threats. The interconnecting of the department’s computer networks with public and other private networks, and sharing of information resources increases the difficulty of achieving control. 

It is essential that the department identify its information security requirements. There are three main sources of these requirements:

* legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements
* the government IT security policies and standards
* assessing the specific risks  to the department’s IT systems

## Assessing and managing information security risk

Security requirements for ICT systems are identified by a methodical assessment of security risks. Expenditure on security controls needs to be balanced against the business harm likely to result from security failures.

Information security controls are considerably cheaper and more effective if incorporated at the system requirements specification and design stage. Information risk assessments must be part of the project process.

Effective risk management continues through the life of IT systems to ensure that the countermeasures are being applied effectively. It is also important to carry out periodic reviews of security risks and implemented controls.
