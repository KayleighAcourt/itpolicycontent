An email account holder can provide another user with delegate access to their account, for example to provide access for personal assistants.

## How do I arrange for an individual to have delegate access to my account?

To set up permissions on your Outlook account:

1.  On the Tools menu, click **Options**, and then click **Delegate**.
2.  Click **Add**.
3.  In the **Add Users** box, enter the name of each person you want to grant permissions to, clicking **Add** after each name.
4.  Click **OK**.
5.  In the **Delegates Permission Level** list, select folders and type of permissions, then click **OK**.
6.  Click **Apply**.

Unfortunately this does not work for all versions of Outlook within MoJ, so if you do not have access to these permissions the account holder must make a request to the IT Ordering Desk, on the Catalogue Order form, providing the following details:

*   Your name and user name
*   Location
*   Name of the person you are giving delegate access to
*   Details of permissions to be applied
*   Specify the wording of an out of office message if appropriate

Sent messages contain both the account holder’s and delegate's names. Message recipients see the account holder’s name in the Sent On Behalf Of box and the delegate's name in the From box.

## How do I arrange for an Out of Office message?

Email the following details to IT Ordering Desk

*   Name and username of the absent employee:
*   Specify the wording of the Out of Office message to be placed on the email account, including an alternative contact

The Service Desk will place an out of office message on the account and notify the requester when this has been completed.

## Can I access emails or information in an absent employee’s email account?

Staff absences do occur and these can cause disruption to MOJ business where colleagues have no access to relevant departmental information.  It is evident from the number of requests received that staff are going on annual leave, secondment and maternity leave etc without making provision for colleagues to access departmental information.

When an absence occurs there is **no** right to be able to access another employee’s account to obtain information. This is relevant where the absence is expected or unexpected, e.g. annual leave or illness.

Accessing another employee’s account, without their permission, contravenes the Data Protection act. 

This Act protects personal information which relates to identifiable, living individuals held on computers. It specifies that appropriate security measures shall be in place to protect against unauthorised access to, loss or destruction of personal data. If you breach this principle you could render the Department liable to enforcement action by the Information Commissioner.

There are limited circumstances in which it is legally possible to gain access to another employee’s email account, these are;

A criminal investigation by a law enforcement agency,

To enable an IT Misuse investigation to be carried out providing it is conducted using appropriate policies, or

On the death of an employee, as the Data Protection act no longer applies.

## Reminder about the storage of MoJ information

Data held by the Department should be managed in such a way that employees who require the data, for business reasons, can gain access to it. Managers should ensure that data is stored in an area that is easily accessible to those who require access. For areas of the Department that have access, this is expected to be TRIM, for other areas a shared drive should be used.

If you need further assistance or information about this process, email Operational Security.

The Department will monitor the use of electronic communications and web-browsing. Your manager can request reports detailing your activity if they suspect inappropriate use of email or web-browsing facilities.
