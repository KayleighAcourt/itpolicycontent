## Why?

Information security is the preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and providing accountability on the use of that information.

- Confidentiality: Ensuring information is only accessible by those authorised to have access;
- Integrity: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods;
- Availability: Ensuring that authorised users have access to information and associated assets when required;
- Accountability: Maintain control of information and proving an audit trail covering its creation, use and disposal.
