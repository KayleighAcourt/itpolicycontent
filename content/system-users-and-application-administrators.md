## How to use this document

<td>This policy applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</td>

### Who does it apply to?

Any remote working User of the [ORGANISATION] ICT systems.

This document is designed to help Users of computing facilities, (e.g. laptop computer or personal digital assistant), within the [ORGANISATION] to access [ORGANISATION] ICT systems in a secure manner. This document applies to all staff including contractors, casuals and service providers, who use computing equipment, provided by the [ORGANISATION] for remote working or mobile computing, or process any departmental information while working remotely or while using mobile computing equipment.

It also sets out Users' individual responsibilities for IT security when using remote working and mobile computing facilities. Everyone accessing [ORGANISATION] ICT systems from remote locations must follow these procedures.

Members of the judiciary who use computer facilities provided by the [ORGANISATION] for remote or mobile working may also find this guide useful but should additionally refer to any separate security guidance provided for the judiciary.

### When and how should these procedures be used?

Users' Security Awareness training will cover these procedures.

In this guide remote working means any working away from the office using computers and telecommunications technologies, whether this is from home, another [ORGANISATION] or government office, whilst travelling, at conferences, or in hotels.

Users should read this document prior to using any [ORGANISATION] ICT Systems for the first time, and revisit it every six (6) months to remind themselves of the procedures. Regular audits will check that these procedures are being followed. Remote working users should also be compliant with:

- System User Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs), [Ref, 2].

Users must understand that they are responsible for maintaining the security of [ORGANISATION] systems, and that failure to comply with these SyOPs could lead to compromise of the [ORGANISATION]'s infrastructure or even the entire GSI. Users must note further that either failure to comply with this SyOPs or failure to return the security sign off form would be considered a breach of the [ORGANISATION] IT Security Policy [Ref, 1].

Area of control
All Users
Application Administrators only
Shut-down and start-up
Start-up:

The sharing of credentials, and attempting to logon as someone else (or with credentials which you are not authorised to use), are strictly forbidden.
Shut-down:
Users must log-off the workstation and ensure it is switched off whenever left unattended for more than 4 hours or overnight.
Physical access controls
Only authorised members of staff with registered user accounts are permitted access to the system.
The equipment used to access the system must be checked on a daily basis for evidence of tampering or suspicious devices attached to it, for example unknown Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices attached to the rear of the main workstation.
Protectively marked and sensitive hardcopy material must be securely stored away under lock and key following the [ORGANISATION] Clear Desk Policy [Ref, 2], published on the [ORGANISATION] intranet.
When accessing the system from portable computing devices, access is only to be made in approved area (see the SyOPs for Remote Access use [Ref, 5]).
Visitors must be supervised during working hours, and any sensitive documentation being worked on is to be hidden from line of sight as much as possible.
Awareness
When visitors are present, ensure that they are only able to see information for which they have a need-to-know.
Users must be aware of anyone ‘shoulder surfing’ and viewing information for which they do not have a need-to-know.
Users must not hold conversations over any telephone or send communications via fax or email if the information being discussed is protectively marked RESTRICTED.
Identification and authentication
Users must not attempt to log on as another user, or share their system access credentials with others.
Users must not allow unauthorised users to observe their screen.
Users must not allow any person to observe them entering their system access credentials (e.g. password).
Passwords used on the system must be created in line with the [ORGANISATION] Password Standard [Ref, 7]. Passwords must be a minimum of 9 characters long and use a mix of lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters.
Users must invoke the screensaver before leaving their workstation unattended (by pressing ‘windows’ key + L).
A User account must only be created with permissions commensurate to that User’s business role, and are only to be enabled once a signed copy of these SyOPs have been received from the user.
A User account must be disabled when that staff member leave the [ORGANISATION] or where their business role does not require them to have access.
 
Resetting user passwords
To change a password, Users must hold down Ctrl + Alt + Delete on their keyboard and select 'Change Password'. They cannot change their password more than once in 48 hours.
If the password requires resetting, the Self Service Password Reset (SSPR) utility must be used and can be accessed via:  https://accountselfservice.dom1.infra.int/pmf/SelfService/Main.html.
System Use
Users must not exceed (or attempt to exceed) their given access privileges, amend the system configuration or plug in any unauthorised devices.
Any unauthorised attempt at changing the configuration of the system, escalating privileges or installing devices/software may be subject to investigation and formal disciplinary action.
Unauthorised software must not be installed or used on the system.
Administrator level accounts should only be used when carrying out administrative tasks; at all other times a Normal User account should be used.
 
Acceptable use
The system must only be used in accordance with the [ORGANISATION] Acceptable Use Policy [Ref, 3].
The system must only be used for the business purposes for which it is intended.
Any attempt to use it for other reasons may constitute a disciplinary offence.
Import/Export
A log must be maintained of all file imports/exports, this can either be a paper based or held electronically.
All imports/export of electronic data/files to the System must be scanned for malicious code.
Users must check and file exports to ensure that only files that they intended to export from one environment to another are exported.

Anti virus
In the event of a User suspecting a virus attack on the network, they must carry out the following steps:
If operationally possible, leave the system switched on in its infected condition;
Disconnect the affected workstation from the network (where possible);
Mark the system and any associate storage media with a label stating that the machine has a suspected virus;
Inform the Information Technology (IT) Helpdesk who will provide assistance.
Removable media
No System media or document is to be removed from the building without prior authorisation from the Information Asset Owner.
All media and documents exported from the system must be registered in the media/document register and clearly marked with their protective marking in accordance with the Information Classification and Handling Policy [Ref, 3].

The export must be covered by an Information Sharing Agreement between the Authority and the external body which has been approved by the Information Asset Owner.
Each export must be authorised by the Local/System Manager.
Each export must have a data export receipt filled out and returned by the receiver to account for the transactions successful delivery
