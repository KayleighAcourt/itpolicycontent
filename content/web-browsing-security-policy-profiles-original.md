## Web browsing security policy profiles (Original)

There are 5 different policy groups including a default for the Judiciary and a Standard Internet profile. A further 3 groups have been specifically set up to allow different access levels to the Internet depending on business need. An audit exercise has been undertaken by Operational Security to obtain business case approvals for any user requiring access to any group other than the Standard Internet profile and this has resulted in everyone being mapped to the appropriate group prior to the Trustwave implementation.

If you have not completed a business case form and had this approved, you will have been mapped to the Standard Internet group.

Please see the table below for details of all the policy groups:

| Group No | User community | Web restriction policy group | Webmail permitted | Activity logged | Activity reported |
