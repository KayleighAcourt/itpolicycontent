## Why?

The SIRO Board ensures the MoJ achieves the required standards of information assurance and compliance through:

*   Agreeing departmental information management and information security strategies and policies;
*   Assessing risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets, as recorded on the MoJ risk register, at least quarterly;
*   Prioritising and supporting information risk management activities as appropriate;
*   Championing information assurance best practice across the Department, raising staff awareness and establishing a culture of good information handling to support business objectives;

Ensuring information governance structures are appropriate, adequate, and linked to other areas of departmental activity.
