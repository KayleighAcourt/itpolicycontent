Do not use auto-forwarding to forward emails from any GSI email address to an email address that provides a lower level of security than the GSI e.g. all internet email addresses and some secure email systems such as the CJSM.

As a GSI email address user, you may receive emails that include sensitive information from colleagues within your organisation or from other GSI connected government departments and organisations. 

You are responsible for ensuring that you handle all information in line with the standards required for the classification of that information.  This means that you must not send that information to an email address where the required security standards are not met.

Your email system may automatically stop you setting auto-forward to external email addresses, but if you are able to set auto-forward, you may only do so if you have a genuine business need to do so.  Please contact the Operational Security Team to discuss your requirements.

If you do set auto-forward from your email address to an email address that does not meet the same security standards, you won’t be able to assess whether it is appropriate to forward the information received to another email address.  The result is that you will not be able to meet your responsibility to help ensure the security of information held by your organisation.

Provided that there is a genuine business need, it is acceptable to set auto-forward from one email address to another with the same or higher security standards, for example:  

*   from one GSI email address to another
*   from an xGSi email address to another xGSI email address
*   to a GSI email address to an xGSI email address (but not the other way round)

Where the guidance is that ‘additional measures’ should be taken before sending emails to a particular type of email address, auto-forward should not be set to send to these email addresses from a GSI email account e.g. from a GSI email account to a CJSM email account.  Special permission may be given for these sorts of auto-forwards in exceptional circumstances, by your IT Security Officer.
