## Email threats

Email scams using familiar email addresses to forge legitimate emails, are becoming more frequent and pose the biggest threat to our IT systems from viruses and hackers.  
MoJ scans approximately 10 million messages a month for threats. Of these we might expect to find 600,000 spam messages and 23,000 virus messages. However, not every virus or spam email will be identified and blocked.

## How can you avoid spam?

*   Avoid opening potential spam emails – this may alert the ‘spammer’ you have viewed their message
*   Don’t open attachments or click on links in spam emails – even if the email appears to be from someone you know. Check the style and content if it isn’t consistent with previous emails it could be spam
*   Do not reveal personal or other sensitive information in response to automatic email requests
*   Where possible, avoid posting your email address on the internet. These may be used by rogue automatic software programs
*   Don’t use your MOJ email address to register for non-work related sites  

If you think you’ve received spam or a virus, report it immediately to the IT Service Desk. Do not click on any link or forward it to anyone. You should delete it from your inbox when advised.

## What are the threats?

*   Viruses: These can be spread between computers in emails or their attachments. They can make PCs, software or documents unusable.
*   Spam: This is unsolicited mail sent in bulk. Clicking on links in spam email may send users to phishing websites or sites hosting malware. Often email spam mimics the addresses of people you know.
*   Phishing: These are emails disguised to look like a legitimate company or bank to illegitimately obtain personal information. They usually ask you to verify your personal information or account details. Often links will direct you to a fake website, made to look like the real thing.
*   Social engineering: In the context of security, social engineering refers to manipulating people to do something or divulge confidential information. For example, this could be a call from someone pretending to be from Microsoft claiming that a virus has been found on their PC and they require personal details to remove the virus.
*   Spoofing: A spoofed email is where the sender (in this case, a criminal) purposely alters part of the email to make it look as though it was from someone else. Commonly, the sender’s name/address and the body of the message are made to look as though it was from a legitimate source. It is commonly used to trick the recipient into providing their confidential information such as passwords or to dishonestly market an online service or sell a bogus product. To check the real sender of any email you receive you can follow the below steps:
    *   In an open message, click 'View'.
    *   Click 'Options'.
    *   The message options will display a list of information. The last line - 'return-path' will tell you where any reply would go. If the address is one you don't recognise do not click on any link contained within the email.
    *   If you are not expecting the email, do not reply to the email. If there is a file attachment, do not open it as it may contain a virus. If you are at all suspicious, please do not divulge your private information.
