## Policy Statement
The Ministry of Justice adheres to the HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) and complies with its mandatory requirements, establishing a clear framework across MOJ for the identification, assessment and management of security risks in a way that:

*   Is clear, available and understood by staff and delivery partners
*   Is embedded into business plans and processes
*   Enables business operations whilst providing protection, and 
*   Provides a basis for enforcement and assurance
*   Complies with relevant legislation

Our security arrangements are designed to:

*   protect staff and those who use or visit our premises, or provide services on our behalf, from injury or harm;
*   protect the Department’s property and equipment from loss or damage;
*   maintain the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information; and thereby
*   enable and maintain service delivery and public confidence.

We will do this by identifying the threats, assessing the associated risks and introducing proportionate protective measures. 

### Who does it apply to?

This policy statement establishes the general security framework for the whole of the Ministry of Justice including its agencies and arms length bodies. 

Each business area (group, agency or arms length body) must establish arrangements for addressing each element of the Security Policy Framework:

1. Governance and security approaches
*   Roles, accountability and responsibilities
*   Risk management
*   Culture, education and awareness
*   Managing and recovering from incidents
2. Security of Information
*   Information policy
*   Valuing and classifying assets
*   Risk assessment and accreditation of IT systems
*   Technical controls
*   Procedural measures
*   Delivery partners and 3rd Party Suppliers
*   Managing and reporting security incidents
3. Personnel Security
*   Recruitment checks and national security vetting
*   Ongoing personnel security management
*   appeals
4. Physical security and counter-terrorism
*   Security risk assessment
*   Internal controls
*   Building and perimeter security
*   Preparing for critical incidents
*   Responding to critical incidents

The SPF is available on the Cabinet Office web-site at:  [http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/security-policy-framework](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/security-policy-framework)

A schedule describing corporate arrangements for each of these mandatory requirements will be maintained on the MOJ intranet.  This framework includes separate policies dealing with:

*   information security;
*   IT security 
*   security breach;
*   counter-terrorist protective security;
*   business continuity; and
*   criminal record checking.

The MOJ intranet also provides more detailed guidance on standard procedures for staff.  

Agencies and arms length bodies (ALBs) are expected to comply with this corporate framework but may establish their own arrangements tailored to operational needs, and should supplement it with local policy/guidance for any business-specific risk.
Some controls such as those for IT security systems and national security vetting will be managed centrally. 

Compliance with SPF is mandatory but where, on an exception basis, business areas consider that a requirement should not apply, or where local arrangements do not comply with the SPF or MOJ arrangements, the variation should be agreed by the relevant Accounting Officer and reported in annual governance processes.

Business areas should also ensure that control requirements are understood and complied with by any contractor or third party entrusted with protectively marked or business critical information and with unsupervised access to our property.
 
## Counter-Terrorist Protection Policy

This policy should be read in conjunction with the HMG Security Policy Framework, MOJ's corporate security policy, the corporate business continuity policy, and local emergency procedures.

The Ministry of Justice is committed to protecting its staff, visitors, information, buildings and other assets from terrorist attack.  The focus will be on prevention but will also provide for effective response. We will achieve this by: 

*   monitoring and regularly reviewing threats; 
*   classifying sites according to risk levels; 
*   implementing baseline security measures appropriate to the threats with arrangements for enhancing protection as the response level increases; 
*   raising awareness to maintain vigilance and reporting of potential problems;
*   ensuring clear allocation of responsibility for implementation of baseline measures, crisis management and business continuity; and 
*   arranging compliance checking with provision of assurance to the Executive Management Board and Permanent Secretary.

### Roles and responsibilities

The Departmental Security Officer (DSO) will communicate advice on threats, including changes in UK threat assessment and HMG 'response levels' to business areas via their security officers.  The DSO will advise the Permanent Secretary of actions taken if there is any change in response level.

Security officers, liaising with estates teams and business representatives, must undertake local risk assessment, checking compliance with baseline standards and determining appropriate levels of protection for sites.  These assessments must have regard to the impact on the business/site, informed by assessment of threat, likelihood and vulnerability.  Such assessments will normally include consideration of both terrorist and other threats. 

### Risk Assessment

All MOJ sites are to be assessed as to whether they are at low, medium or high risk from terrorist attack, using HMG guidelines   Sites assessed as being at moderate risk must assess and document the threat and set out how this is mitigated by site security specification and operational controls.   All locations, regardless of assessed level, must have a local Counter-terrorist plan detailing how they will vary operational controls according to changes in the response level. The level of operational controls should reflect the risk classification of the site, with “moderate risk” sites requiring more robust arrangements than “low risk” sites. Corporate Security Branch can provide advice on CT Plans to Local Security Officers.

### Protection

Protection against terrorism should be proportionate and include proactive and preventive measures such as patrolling to deter reconnaissance, CCTV monitoring, physical strengthening/stand-off measures, vetting checks, as well as reactive operational measures during periods of heightened response, and emergency response plans that protect people and assets in the event of an attack.

### Incident Response

All business areas/sites must have clear emergency response arrangements to cover the response to direct or indirect impact from a terrorist threat or attack.  These arrangements will normally be incorporated within Fire & Incident Control and business continuity arrangements and should include arrangements for liaising with emergency services and for communicating with staff.

Staff must familiarise themselves with local procedures and comply with any instruction from the Fire & Incident Control Officer.

### Co-ordination

MOJ's Corporate Business continuity arrangements will be used to co-ordinate across MOJ for events that affect more than one business area.  Co-ordination will be supported by the Corporate Security and Business Continuity team who will provide liaison with the Civil Contingencies Secretariat.  For incidents having a significant effect on delivery of MOJ’s front-line services (courts, tribunals, prisons), the co-ordination role may be taken by the Strategic Co-ordination Group (Gold), chaired by NOMS Gold Commander.

### Personnel security 
Those with access to information or other assets that may be of value to terrorists, including close proximity or access to high profile public figures, should be assessed for the need for national security clearance in accordance with vetting procedures.

### Testing and exercising

Counter-terrorist plans should be tested periodically.   Plans for medium risk sites should be tested at least once every two years and for low risk sites every 3-5 years as part of general business continuity testing and exercising.  

### Assurance

Assurance of the adequacy of arrangements and compliance with this policy will be covered by the annual Governance Statement, supplemented by SRMO compliance returns and periodic review of risk and contingency arrangements by management teams.

## Information Security Policy

Information security supports the preservation of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information:

*   Confidentiality: Ensuring information is only accessible by those authorised to have access;
*   Integrity: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods; 
*   Availability: Ensuring that authorised users have access to information and associated assets when required.

The Ministry of Justice regards the protection of its information as vital in order to meet its key objectives, in maintaining public and supplier confidence that the information we hold will be kept secure, to ensure the continuity of government services and systems, and to ensure that we contribute to the effectiveness of arrangements for maintaining the security of shared systems such as the Government Secure Intranet.

The Ministry of Justice recognises the importance of complying with the statutory requirement for information security in order to protect those who entrust their information, including sensitive personal data to us and protect its reputation with the public, the judiciary, other public sector organisations and voluntary and private sector organisations. The Ministry of Justice aims to be exemplary in complying with the Human Rights Act 1998, data protection legislation and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, for which it is the lead department.

To this end the Ministry of Justice is committed to achieving best practice in the way we manage information security by complying with the mandatory requirements relating to information security and assurance contained in the Security Policy Framework and supporting HMG Information Assurance Standards.

Our approach to Information Assurance will be based on the ownership of information risks by Information Asset Owners within the business.  It is not the sole responsibility of central service providers (IT Services and IT suppliers) though these will play their part in delivering the required security where this is best done centrally, or by security staff, whose role is to provide advice. The Ministry of Justice will aim to realise the benefits of a business oriented approach to information security in terms of informed decision making, resource savings, efficiency and reputation. A member of the Executive Management Board is designated as Ministry of Justice’s Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO).

This high level policy statement is supported by a suite of policies on various aspects of IT and information security.
