Hoax letters are designed to trick you into believing, or accepting as genuine, something false and often preposterous: the messages they contain are usually untrue.

Hoax messages try to get you to pass them on to everyone you know using several different methods of social engineering. Most of the hoax messages play on your need to help other people. Who wouldn't want to warn there friends about some terrible virus that is destroying people's systems? Or help this poor little girl who is about to die from cancer?.

Chain letters and hoax messages have the same purpose but use a slightly different method of coercing you into passing them on. Chain letters, like their printed ancestors, generally offer luck or money if you send them on (scams). They play on your fear of bad luck and the knowledge that it is easy for you to send them on. Scams play on people's greed and are illegal no matter what they say in the letter.

## The risk and cost of hoaxes

The cost and risk associated with hoaxes may not seem to be that high. If, however, you consider the cost of everyone within the department receiving one hoax message, spending two minutes reading it and another two minutes forwarding it on or discarding it, the cost can be significant

Handling these messages may also make our mail servers slow down to a crawl or crash.

Spammers (bulk mailers of unsolicited mail) may harvest email addresses from hoaxes and chain letters. Many of these letters contain hundreds of legitimate addresses, which is what the spammers want. There are also rumours that spammers are deliberately starting hoaxes and chain letters to gather email addresses.

## How to recognise a hoax

A request to "send this to everyone you know" (or some variant) should raise a red flag. Te warning is probably a hoax - it's unlikely a real warning message from a credible source will tell you to send it to everyone you know.

If the warning uses technical language, most people, including technologically savvy individuals, tend to believe the warning is real.

There may be credibility by association. If the janitor at a large technological organisation sends a warning to someone outside of that organisation, people on the outside tend to believe the warning because the company should know about those things. Even though the person sending the warning may not have a clue what he is talking about, the prestige of the company backs the warning, making it appear real.

These make it very difficult to be certain a warning is a hoax so you must check with ITSB to see if the claims are real and if the person sending out the warning is a real person and is someone who would know what they are talking about.

## Type of hoaxes 

### Scam chains

Mail messages that appear to be from a legitimate company but that are scams and cons eg Nigerian 419 scams

### Give aways

Stories about give aways by large companies. If you only send this on, some big company will send you a lot of money, clothes, a free vacation, etc., etc. Expect to wait a long time for any of these to pay off. (BA free tickets?)

### Malicious warnings (virus hoaxes)

Warnings about Trojans, viruses, and other malicious code that have no basis in fact eg Jdbgmgr.exe.

Virus hoaxes have flooded the internet with thousands of viruses worldwide. Paranoia in the internet community fuels such hoaxes. Anxample of this is the "Good Times" virus hoax, which started in 1994 and is still circulating the internet today. Instead of spreading from one computer to another by itself, Good Times relies on people to pass it along.

### Sympathy letters and requests to help someone

Requests for help or sympathy for someone who has had a problem or accident.

### Urban myths

Warnings and stories about bad things happening to people and animals that never really happened.

### Inconsequential warnings

Out of date warnings and warnings about real things that are not really much of a problem.

### True legends

Real stories and messages that are not hoaxes but are still making the rounds of the internet.

### Traditional chain letters

Traditional chain letters that threaten bad luck if you do not send them on or request that you send money to the top _x_ people on the list before sending it on.

### Threat chains

Mail that threatens to hurt you, your computer, or someone else if you do not pass on the message.

### Scare chains

Mail messages that warn you about terrible things that happen to people (especially women).

### Jokes

Warning messages that it's hard to imagine anyone would believe.
