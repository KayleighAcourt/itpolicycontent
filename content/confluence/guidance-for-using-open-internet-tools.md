## Quick checklist

To help you decide if you can use an Open Internet Tool (OIT) to work on an MOJ task, consider the following questions:

- Does the information belong to a specific part of the MOJ that has specific rules and requirements, for example HMPPS?
- Is the information classified as anything other than `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE`?
- Does the information include any data that can be identified as being about someone?
- Is this the first time using the tool for MOJ business?

If the answer to _any_ of these questions is 'Yes', get guidance from your Line Manager, _before_ using the tool.

## Overview

Open Internet Tools (OITs) are applications or services from suppliers outside the MOJ. They often have the following characteristics:

- They are general purpose. This means they are not specific to the MOJ. Other organisations can use them.
- They are accessed using the Internet. This means that if you have Internet access, you can connect to the tools.
- They often have a basic 'free-to-use' version. This means that you can use some or all the capabilities, but with some constraints. For example, an online word-processor might let you work with no more than 5 documents.
- They often have one or more 'paid for' versions. By paying for the tool, you unlock some or all the constraints.

### Why OITs are an opportunity for the MOJ

OITs offer some significant advantages for the MOJ, including:

- Usually cheaper than buying or building and supporting a dedicated tool.
- No need to build or support the tool.
- Good use of open standards, such as file formats.
- Reduced need to have specific hardware or software on computers.
- Rapid patching to address security issues.
- Easy updating as new features are deployed.
- A large pool of help and support.
- Easy access, whenever you have a network connection.
- Increasing availability of some or all capabilities offline (when disconnected from the network).

### Why OITs are a risk for the MOJ

OITs also pose some threats or risks, including:

- Dependency on the tool and supplier.
- Security of access to the tool.
- Security of information stored within or processed by the tool.
- Potential difficulty of enhancing or customising the tool for MOJ-specific requirements.

But as long you consider the threats or risks, and address them, OITS provide many benefits for the MOJ.

### Summary

With careful use, OITs help you to work more effectively and efficiently. Think about them as serious and preferable options for performing tasks.

## Common OITs

There are already many OITs used across the MOJ. Permission to use an OIT might vary, depending on where you work in the MOJ.

The OITs fall into two groups: hosting and tools.

### Hosting

The MOJ has formally obtained some cloud services. These include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (Office 365), and Google (Google Apps). They are generally assured (approved) for use with `OFFICIAL` and `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` material.

Personal cloud services are not assured or approved for use with MOJ business. An example is your own personal Google account.

### Tools

Several tools seen in use within the MOJ are not formally assured or approved for use. However, they are acceptable for working with `OFFICIAL` and `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` material.

Examples include:

- Appear.in
- Float
- GitHub
- Google Hangouts
- Lucidchart
- Skype for Business
- Slack
- Trello

It's always a good idea to drop a note to your Line Manager to let them know you are planning to use an OIT for your work.

## Using OITs

This guidance helps you:

- Understand the conditions or constraints that apply to a tool, or a task performed using a tool.
- Identify and address threats or risks posed by a new tool.
- Identify and champion new tools that might benefit the MOJ.
- Understand what tools are available for you to use.

### Conditions for using an OIT

#### Thinking about privacy and personal information

Data protection legislation means you are responsible for personal information you work with. You must keep it safe and secure.

Unless you get consent in advance from anyone affected, don't use OITs for storing personal data. Never use OITs for information that might cause damage or distress to an individual if disclosed unlawfully.

Complying with personal information requirements can be complex. Don't hesitate to ask for advice:<br/>

#### Thinking about classification and security

Only store or process information [classified](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) at `OFFICIAL` level using an OIT.

Think about the MOJ information you work with.  What would happen if you lost it, or it's stolen, or published in the media? Suppose the information was overheard in a cafe, or read from your screen on a crowded train. Could there be damaging consequences? If the answer is 'No', then it's probably OK to use OITs to store or send that information.

Think also about information moving across the Internet. The data might be safe within the MOJ and in an approved OIT. But what about the connection between the two? Sending information might involve insecure networks. Be aware of the security implications. Check that enough suitable security measures are in place to protect the information. For example, check for encryption of network connections using [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). A simple way to do this is to look for the secure connection indicator in your web browser:<br/>
![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/guidance-for-using-open-internet-tools-01.png)

You have a duty of confidentiality and a responsibility to safeguard any HMG information or data that you access. This is ([Principle 2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) of the Government Security Classifications). The MOJ trusts you to work with `OFFICIAL` information. In the same way, you're trusted to make a reasoned judgement about whether it's safe to use an OIT.

Useful help for deciding what is OK is in [existing social media guidance](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/11/social-media-policy-guidance.pdf). While it's more about how to act online, the principles are helpful for OITs.

Remember that it is impossible to delete information after it's released in public.

For more information on IT Security, consult the information on the MOJ Intranet [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/).

#### Thinking about storage and data retention

Various laws and regulations mean the MOJ and its employees are responsible for managing information. Some examples of relevant legislation include:

- the Freedom of Information Act
- the Data Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulation
- the Public Records Acts

When we receive a request for information, we need to know where we hold all the relevant information. Storing business information on appropriate MOJ systems helps us, because:

- it protects you and the MOJ by making it easy to provide evidence of why decisions have been made
- it helps everyone understand what information is held, and where to find it
- it enables the MOJ to transfer policy and court records to The National Archives

So, always store MOJ information in MOJ systems. If you use an OIT, make sure the key information is also definitively and safely stored in an appropriate MOJ system. Guidance on what you must keep is available [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/managing-information/what-to-keep/). When you finish some work, transfer the information to an appropriate MOJ system. Don't forget to remove any redundant information from the OIT.

Most OITs let you export your data. You can then store it on an appropriate MOJ system. Sometimes it's easier to copy and paste text into a new document. Make sure that the right people have access to the information. This is important after staff or organisational changes, for example.

For more guidance, read the [MOJ Information Management Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/04/information-management-policy.pdf) and the help on [responding to requests for information](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/providing-information-to-the-public/freedom-of-information/).

#### Thinking about service and support

OITs are often intuitive and reliable. But that doesn't mean they are always available and always work as you expect. The MOJ isn't responsible for providing technical support or ensuring service availability. Always have another way of working if the OIT is not available for some reason or for any length of time. In other words, don't let an OIT become business critical.

## Information management

## Personal data

You are responsible under the Data Protection Act (DPA) for the security and stewardship of personal data in your care. We would advise that open Internet tools are generally unsuitable for the transmission or storage of citizens' data, unless their consent is gained; and always unsuitable for data that would cause damage or distress to an individual if disclosed, including sensitive personal data as defined by the DPA. You should take particular care if you are handling citizens' personal data that you comply with the DPA; the [Data Compliance team](mailto:data.compliance@justice.gsi.gov.uk) can advise on how to do so.

The DPA imposes broad responsibilities on organisations to protect personal data and sets out definitions for [personal and sensitive personal data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/#personal-data). The responsibilities are explained in more detail [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-2-purposes/). The DPA also obliges organisations to take "appropriate technical and organisational measures against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data." For in depth guidance relating to what this means in practice please consult <https://www.ico.org.uk/>.

A further requirement of the DPA is that "personal data shall not be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless [that country ensures an adequate level of protection](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-8-international/#adequate)". Most tools should make this clear in their Privacy Policy or terms and conditions the locations where they process data, but you may need to contact the company if it is unclear. When using a new tool, you need to ensure that you are fulfilling your responsibilities under the DPA.

There may be occasions when you process citizen personal data online – this could be when you crowdsource ideas when you run an Open Policy Making exercise, for example – but when doing so, you should consider the requirements of the DPA and any privacy risks by completing a [Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/privacy-impact-assessments/). Open Internet tools may not be suitable for the transmission or storage of large volumes of personal data but you may need to transmit or store small amounts to be able to use the tool effectively. For example, you may need to use the names of colleagues when assigning tasks in a tool like Trello. You should discuss this with your team to ensure they understand how their personal data will be used.

For more information on the DPA please visit <https://ico.org.uk/> or direct any queries to the [Data Access and Compliance Unit](mailto:data.access@justice.gsi.gov.uk). You can find out more about MOJ's Data Protection responsibilities [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/personal-data/).

## Service and support

While Open Internet Tools are designed to be intuitive and reliable, MOJ Technology is not responsible for providing technical support and ensuring service availability. Given that the department has no control over these tools, you should not use them in such a way as they become business critical.

Open Internet Tools are services provided online by third party companies. These companies depend on providing an easy-to-use and reliable service to retain their customers. In general, they provide clear and concise support documentation to help you get the most out of the tools they offer. They are generally available to use 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with only occasional downtime for maintenance and improvement.

Because these services are offered outside of MOJ's Service Level Agreements with our existing technology suppliers, MOJ Technology is not responsible for providing support and ensuring that the services are available. You should consider how to use these platforms in the knowledge that if something goes wrong it is the tool supplier, rather than MOJ, who is responsible for helping you.

Many tools provide excellent support on their websites. In the unlikely event that the tools are not available, they malfunction, they lose your data, or you don't know how to do something, you will rely on support from the tool supplier to fix your issue. It is important to be aware that you may not always be able to speak to someone for help.

You may like to check the User Agreement of a given tool to find out more about the service and support it offers.
