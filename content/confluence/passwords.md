Passwords are essential for protecting the department\'s IT systems. Passwords help control access to the information stored and managed on the systems. Passwords help assure identity, and so permit authorised access.

You should protect your passwords to the best of your ability.

This guidance document tells you more about passwords, and your responsibilities for them. For more detailed information about choosing and using passwords, see the [Password Standard][ps].

## Always\.\.\.

- Choose and use a password for information, services or systems that is strong enough to provide sufficient protection for the classification level of that information, services or system.
- Use a password manager, to help you choose and store your passwords.
- Use a password that has a combination of upper case characters, lower case characters, digits, and special characters such as '`@`', '`$`', '`%`', or '`^`'.
- Change your password after a security incident involving the information, service, or system that is protected by the password.

## Never\.\.\.

- Use a password for more than one account or service.
- Re-use a password.
- Write a password down.
- Share a password with anyone, unless it is authorised for accessing a shared account, service, or system.

**Note:** Unauthorised sharing of a password is a significant breach of security and might result in disciplinary action.

## Passwords for a new account

When a new account is created you will be provided with a one-time use password.

Once you have entered your password you should be prompted to change it.

If you are not prompted to change your password, you should register for the self service password service and change your password immediately. If you experience any problems you should contact the IT service desk.

## What happens when my password needs to be reset?

If you do forget your password, you can reset it straight away by clicking on the \'forgotten password\' link on the login box.

## Self service password service

If you haven't already enrolled, it is urgent that you do so now. Copy and paste the following link into your browser: https://accountselfservice.dom1.infra.int/pmf/SelfService/ and set up your personalised security questions, the answers and your memorable word. Or go to Favourites in your Internet browser and click 'Account Self Service'.

## How to reset your Security `BeCrypt` (`eToken`) password

To reset your password you will need to contact the IT Service Desk. They will check whether they have your memorable word. Where they do, you will be asked to confirm certain characters of the word and your password will be reset and you will quickly regain access to your laptop.

If you are registered for the Self Service Password service and do not have a memorable word or you are unable to remember it, your identity will need to be confirmed by another method and this may add a delay in your incident being resolved. You will be requested to ask your line manager or court manager to confirm your identity by sending an email to the IT Service Desk on receipt of the email the IT Service Desk will reset your password.

## Sharing passwords

Sharing passwords is strictly prohibited by MoJ's security policy (see Section 10.1 of the IT security guide). If this policy is breached, the MoJ connection to the Government secure internet may be cancelled. It is essential that our connection remains valid in order for the Department to continue to communicate securely.

### National guidance:

* All government departments must comply with and satisfy defined HMG security standards
* All users must be uniquely identified and authenticated with a User ID and password
* All users on the network must be auditable

### What does this mean to me?

As a MoJ IT user, you are NOT permitted to:

*   attempt to gain unauthorised access to another person's email account
*   attempt to use another identity (User ID) or share your password with anyone else
*   attempt to access information outside of your normal access rights or duties
*   disclose your password

### Are there any exceptions whereby a password can be shared?
 
Very occasionally the normal use of a particular application may be by way of a shared username and/or password. Unless the application user guide specifically allows password sharing you __must not__ share your password with anyone. If you would like to refer to a specific application guide please contact the relevant application owner.

### What do I do if I need access to another user's account?

Under no circumstances should you share a user name and password with another person. Delegated access permissions can be set up in Outlook to provide other people with the required access to accounts. Passwords do not need to be disclosed. If you would like to know how to set up delegate permissions you should contact the IT service desk.
