## General Use

As a general principle, you should only use Digital Services systems to view, download and process material for official purposes.  Use of the internet for purposes such as e.g. E-banking during your lunch break is acceptable, as long as it is kept to a reasonable minimum.  You must not use Digital Services systems in any way that is unlawful or illegal or in a way that impairs the effective use of the systems by other users, or for excessive private use during working time.

Nobody may use Digital Services systems, either directly or indirectly (unless authorised to do so) for the following:

- To transmit, publish, link to, make available, send or knowingly receive any material which is defamatory, abusive, obscene, indecent, racist, offensive to creed, gender, marital status, sexuality or religious beliefs, harmful, threatening, menacing or liable to incite such unacceptable behaviour;
- In a way that will be a breach of any person's rights, including a breach of confidence, copyright, privacy, data protection or any other rights;
- In breach of any instructions contained in the latest version of this policy document or other Digital Services rules or regulations. Personnel will be informed of any changes to the policy when they occur;
- In a way that can be considered to constitute a criminal or civil offence;
- In a way that does not conform with the acceptable use or anti-spam policies of any connected networks, the standards of the Advertising Standards Authority, or normal professional standards, including the acceptable use policy of the organisation to which a document or message is being sent, or any Internet standards for acceptable use. In short, all communications should be conducted in a professional and responsible manner;
- To infringe by the use of any domain name, individual name or otherwise upon the rights of any other person in a trade mark or name whether in statute or common law;
- To send email or any other type of electronic message with the intention or result of directly affecting the performance or functionality of any computer facilities. This means you must take reasonable care to ensure that your actions do not have an adverse affect on any other computer systems;
- For storing personal data (subject to the exception given above) or installing unlicensed or unauthorised software, including games, free/shareware, screensavers, etc. or any other software for the purpose of customising your IT environment, without the express written permission of the Digital Services Director;
- To connect unauthorised equipment (including PDAs) to the Digital Services network, the internet or other Digital Services systems; and,
- To access, copy or alter files belonging to any other user without their express permission (e.g. in a share to which you have been granted access) or as part of your job.

## Security

It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your Digital Services hardware and the security of your username and password.

## Web and e-mail Content

Nobody may use the systems, either directly or indirectly:

- To threaten, harass or cause distress, annoyance or discomfort to any other person or organisation;
- To intentionally disrupt or adversely affect any other person or organisation's access to, or use of, the Internet or any features which form part of the Internet;
- To transmit or cause to be transmitted personal communications, offensive material, executable code not written or approved by Digital Services, mail bombs, and chain letters or pyramid schemes;
- To send any document or communication that could form a binding contract or could obligate Digital Services in any way unless authorised to do so;
- To send any commercially sensitive data, confidential information, proprietary or intellectual property to external addressees unless authorised to do so;
- To download, run or install any executable program or attachment, utility, freeware, shareware or otherwise, that has not been written in-house or in collaboration with a 3rd party under an approved agreement, without permission from the Head of IA; and,
- To make sensitive information available over the Intranet or internet without permission from the Director.
