## System recovery

Backing up is an essential part of protecting MOJ Information and Communication Technology (ICT or IT) resources. Backing up provides a means of recovering a system or data to a known state, or point in time. In other words, backups enable you to restore a system or data to be effectively indistinguishable from how it was on a particular date and time.

All systems MUST comply with the [HMG Security Policy Framework](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/). To address this need, these statements from the MOJ [Technical Controls Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/technical-controls-policy/) apply:

Policy | Statement
---|---
[POL.TCP.108] | All systems MUST have recovery procedures to maintain the integrity and availability of all Information Assets held. The recovery time will vary based on the system and data involved.
[POL.TCP.109] | A log MUST be kept of all back-ups taken for an ICT system.
[POL.TCP.110] | Back-up data MUST be stored and handled in a manner appropriate to the sensitivity of the Information Assets stored.
[POL.TCP.111] | All ICT systems MUST check all historic back-ups regularly to ensure that they can be relied upon. This includes the testing of any backup media used, such as tape or hard disks.
[POL.TCP.112] | All systems MUST have a recovery procedure which is tested regularly. Ideally, the testing will take place automatically.
[POL.TCP.113] | The retention period for historic back-ups MUST align to the retention period of the Information Assets held.
[POL.TCP.114] | All ICT systems MUST conform to the ICT Security - System Backup Standard [link to follow].

All ICT systems MUST be evaluated to determine if a backup schedule is required. This depends on the data stored, and on legal or other regulatory requirements. The evaluation and resulting decision regarding backup requirement MUST be documented for the system.

The ICT Security - System Backup Standard [link to follow] provides details of the tasks, configurations, and processes required for an ICT system backup to comply with this policy.
