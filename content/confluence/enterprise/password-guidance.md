## Overview

All government departments must follow HMG security standards. That includes the MoJ. An important part of compliance is ensuring that all users:

- can be identified uniquely
- can be authenticated with a User ID and password
- on the network are auditable

## Always\.\.\.

- use a password that is strong enough for the classification level of the information, services or systems
- use a password manager, to help you choose and store your passwords
- use a password that has a combination of upper case characters, lower case characters, digits, and special characters such as '`@`', '`$`', '`%`', or '`^`'
- change your password after a security incident involving the information, service, or system that is protected by the password

## Never\.\.\.

- use a password for more than one account or service
- re-use a password
- write a password down
- share a password with anyone, unless you are accessing a shared account, service, or system
- access or try to access another person's email account
- use or try to use an identity other than your own
- attempt to access information outside of your normal access rights or duties

**Note:** Unauthorised sharing or use of a password is a security breach. Doing this might result in disciplinary action.

## Passwords for a new account

You get a one-time use password with a new account. The first time you login to the account, you must change the password.

If you are not prompted to change your password, you should find the option to change passwords within the system, and change your password immediately. If you experience any problems, contact the [IT Service Desk](#contacts).

## Forgetting or resetting your password

All MOJ systems and services should have a mechanism for helping when you forget your password. This normally provides a `forgotten password` link at the login stage. Use this to request a password reset email. When you receive the email, follow the instructions to create a new password for the account.

Some systems might not provide a forgotten password option, or it might not be obvious how to reset your password.
In this case, contact the [IT Service Desk](#contacts).
