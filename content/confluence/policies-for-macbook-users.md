Any User of an MOJ Digital supplied MacBook must ensure they comply with this policy to ensure that security is not compromised when using these devices.

These Policies are supplementary to the GOV.UK and MOJ Enterprise policies, procedures and guidance.

If any User is unsure of any of the requirements or content they should contact their Line Manager or MOJ Digital IA personnel for clarification.

## Policies

You must not share your login details/password with anyone under any circumstances

You must change your password regularly, at least every 90 days, or if you suspect it has been compromised

You must not attempt to access any other person's data unless you have been authorised to do so

You must only collaborate with authorised personnel

You must inform your Line Manager and MOJ Digital IA if you are subjected to any security incident or suspect you may be

You must logoff or lock your Mac when leaving it unattended

You must keep your MOJ Digital equipment close to you and in sight at all times when in public areas (Dan V to check with legal reimbursement possibilities and statement required)

## Top things to remember

You are responsible and accountable for the security of your MOJ Digital equipment at all times

If you don't think you should do something you probably shouldn't.  If in doubt always seek advice
