## Source

The policy on forensic readiness is covered in the [IT Security â€“ Forensic Readiness Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/moj-forensic-readiness-policy/) document, this document sets out the MoJ guidance on implementing that policy and developing a Forensic Readiness Plan.
