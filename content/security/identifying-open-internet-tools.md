## Identifying and championing new tools

New OITs are being developed all the time. Some of these might be better suited for the tasks you need to perform. They might provide a solution that didn't exist before. It's helpful to know how to identify and champion a new OIT. The benefit is that it becomes allowed within the MOJ.

The basic process consists of four steps.

1. [Definition](#definition), leading to Prototype.
2. [Alpha](#alpha), leading to Acceptance.
3. [Beta](#beta), leading to Approved.
4. [Gamma](#gamma), leading to Assured.

The four steps encourage and enable adoption of new OITs. You have an essential role to play in the process. If you get blocked in a steps, it might mean an earlier step was not completed successfully or correctly.

Your role is essential because you are championing the new OIT. It may well be that others join you and help advocate for the new tool. But you are the one who spotted the potential of a  OIT to help you in your work, and to help others in their work. During the evaluation of an OIT, you're the natural focus point for status information. This includes monitoring progress through Acceptance, Approval, and Assurance testing. You might have to deal with various 'housekeeping' activities, such as:

- help organise installation or deployment
- grant access to the OIT functionality
- remove access from the OIT
- co-ordinate with other system teams within the MOJ
- create a process for saving material from the OIT into a corporate system
- work out what information or tasks the OIT is suitable for
- identifying other champions for the OIT

... as well as many other related responsibilities.

If this list seems burdensome, ask yourself if the OIT is worth the effort or not.

Without a specific individual being responsible, these activities can get overlooked. In time, this can cause difficulties such as ambiguity about the OITs approval status.

It's important that there's always a champion when a tool is critical to the business unit. Often, when the tool is first used, someone sets up an account and grants others access to that account. If the account holder leaves, access control might become difficult or even impossible. Solving problems of this kind for tools that are not recognised or supported by MOJ technology can be very difficult.

<a id="definition"></a>

### Definition

During the Definition stage, you describe and confirm the business need. Describe example tasks, and why they are good representatives of other tasks.

Next, show why the existing tools cannot meet that the business need.

You can now work to identify a suitable OIT. It must solve the business need, or provide significant help in fulfilling it. The OIT should work in a way that aligns with and promotes MOJ principles and objectives. You might also learn of a new tool from across Government, or through professional bodies.

When you have an OIT in mind, you can investigate the characteristics of the tool. Ask fundamental questions, such as:

- is the tool suitable for general information at `OFFICIAL` classification?
- is the tool compatible with legislative obligations, such as:
    - complying with data protection legislation
    - protecting and deleting information in accord with data retention requirements
    - providing features that support Freedom of Information requests
- what is the cost to try out the tool? What pricing model applies for more extensive or formal use?
- what are the licensing requirements?
- what are the hardware, software, and other operational requirements?
- how is information within the tool kept secure?
- how compatible is the tool with other, existing approved tools within the MOJ?

At the end of this stage, you should have a clear idea of:

- the specific task you want the OIT to perform
- the general tasks the OIT could perform
- the resources needed to use the OIT:
  - on your allocated IT equipment
  - on the wider MOJ IT infrastructure and staff
- the security characteristics of the OIT

With these answers ready, you can seek permission to prototype the tool for performing the task. Do this by contacting your Line Manager and your Tech Support team, so that they know what your plan is and that you have approval to prototype.

<a id="alpha"></a>

### Alpha

During this step, you use the prototype tool to perform the task. Take plenty of notes about how easy it is to configure and use the tool. While focusing on the main task, consider 'edge cases' or unusual scenarios where the tool might not be so successful.

At the end of the task, you should have collected enough evidence to show that:

- the OIT aligns with MOJ good practice and obligations
- it is capable of performing tasks for others within the MOJ
- is it cost-effective

In summary, you have collected material to help justify more serious consideration: acceptance.

<a id="beta"></a>

### Beta

During the [Alpha](#alpha) step, you showed that the OIT is capable of performing tasks to advance MOJ business, and to do so in a way that aligns with MOJ good practice and obligations. However, you were almost certainly using the OIT in evaluation mode. Perhaps not all functions were available. Or they were limited to a small number of components or data sets.

The Beta step focuses on getting the tool recognised as Approved for use within the MOJ. This typically requires funding, technical support, and more formal evaluation within a Triage process. The process is based on the Project Triage process, described [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/it-services/approvals-to-spend/).

For more help with the Beta step, contact your Line Manager and your Tech Support team.

<a id="gamma"></a>

### Gamma

The Gamma step focuses on a technical and information assurance evaluation. This is to help ensure that the technical characteristics, constraints and capabilities are fully understood. This helps with on-going support and strategic planning, now that the OIT is being added to the portfolio of tactical and operational tools.

Not all OITs progress through the Gamma step. However, it provides a greater level of assurance and therefore confidence.

For more help with the Gamma step, contact your Line Manager and your Tech Support team.
