<b>This information applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

## Important note

Open Internet Tools (OITs) are applications or services from suppliers outside the MOJ. When using an OIT, ensure you address privacy and personal information considerations. In particular:

- you must follow data protection obligations
- don't use OITs if unlawful disclosure of the information they process might cause damage or distress

More information about OITs and privacy and personal information is available [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/guidance-for-using-open-internet-tools/#privacy-and-personal-information).

## Identifying and championing new tools

New OITs are being developed all the time. Some of these might be better suited for the tasks you need to perform. They might provide a solution that didn't exist before. It's helpful to know how to identify and champion a new OIT. The benefit is that it becomes allowed within the MOJ.

The basic process consists of four steps.

1. [Prototype](#prototype)
2. [Accept](#acceptance)
3. [Approve](#approved)
4. [Assure](#assured)

The four steps encourage and enable adoption of new OITs. You have an essential role to play in the process. If you get blocked in a steps, it might mean an earlier step was not completed successfully or correctly.

Your role is essential because you are championing the new OIT. It may well be that others join you and help advocate for the new tool. But you are the one who spotted the potential of a  OIT to help you in your work, and to help others in their work. During the evaluation of an OIT, you're the natural focus point for status information. This includes monitoring progress through Acceptance, Approval, and Assurance testing. You might have to deal with various 'housekeeping' activities, such as:

- help organise installation or deployment
- grant access to the OIT functionality
- remove access from the OIT
- co-ordinate with other system teams within the MOJ
- create a process for saving material from the OIT into a corporate system
- work out what information or tasks the OIT is suitable for
- identifying other champions for the OIT

... as well as many other related responsibilities.

If this list seems burdensome, ask yourself if the OIT is worth the effort or not.

Without a specific individual being responsible, these activities can get overlooked. In time, this can cause difficulties such as ambiguity about the OITs approval status.

It's important that there's always a champion when a tool is critical to the business unit. Often, when the tool is first used, someone sets up an account and grants others access to that account. If the account holder leaves, access control might become difficult or even impossible. It's difficult to solve problems like this for tools that are not recognised or supported by the MOJ.

### Prototype

To start this stage, describe and confirm the business need. Think about example tasks, and why they are good representatives of other tasks.

Next, show why existing MOJ tools cannot meet that the business need.

You can now work to identify a suitable OIT. You might also learn of a new tool from across Government, or through professional bodies. It must solve the business need, or provide significant help in fulfilling it. The OIT should work in a way that aligns with and promotes MOJ principles and objectives.

When you have an OIT in mind, investigate the characteristics of the tool. Ask fundamental questions, such as:

- is the tool suitable for general information at `OFFICIAL` classification?
- is the tool compatible with legislative obligations, such as:
    - complying with data protection legislation
    - protecting and deleting information in accord with data retention requirements
    - providing features that support Freedom of Information requests
- what is the cost to try out the tool? What pricing model applies for more extensive or formal use?
- what are the licensing requirements?
- what are the hardware, software, and other operational requirements?
- how is information within the tool kept secure?
- how compatible is the tool with other, existing approved tools within the MOJ?
- how do users or customer organisations supply feedback to the OIT supplier?
- how are individual user accounts managed?
- is it possible to have team accounts?

At the end of this stage, you should have a clear idea of:

- the specific task you want the OIT to perform
- the general tasks the OIT could perform
- the resources needed to use the OIT:
  - on your allocated IT equipment
  - on the wider MOJ IT infrastructure and staff
- the security characteristics of the OIT

When you have the answers, ask permission to prototype the tool for performing the task. Do this by contacting your [Line Manager](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/line-manager-approval/) and your Tech Support team. Make sure that they know what your plan is. Ensure you have their approval to prototype.

<a id="acceptance"></a>

### Accept

During this step, you use the prototype tool to perform the task. Take plenty of notes about how easy it is to configure and use the tool. Think about 'edge cases' or unusual scenarios where the tool might not be so successful.

Collect evidence to show that:

- the OIT aligns with MOJ good practice and obligations
- it is capable of performing tasks for others within the MOJ
- is it cost-effective
- it does not represent an obvious threat to MOJ tasks or information

In summary, aim to collect material to help justify the claim that the OIT is acceptable for use within the MOJ.

*Outline*

- sanity check material with LM.
- likewise with tech support
- likewise with operational security
- likewise with EUCS
- request that the OIT is added to list in 'accept' state

For more help with this step, contact your Line Manager and your Tech Support team.

<a id="approved"></a>

### Approve

During the [Accept](#acceptance) stage, you showed that:

- the OIT is capable of performing tasks to advance MOJ business
- the OIT works in a way that aligns with MOJ good practice and obligations

During acceptance, you probably used the OIT in some kind of evaluation mode. Perhaps not all functions were available. Or there were limits such as a small number of components or data sets.

This step focuses on getting the tool recognised as Approved for use within the MOJ. This typically requires:

- funding
- technical support
- more formal evaluation

The evaluation process uses the MOJ project triage process, described [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/it-services/approvals-to-spend/).

*Outline*

- need information about administration capability for 'approve' or higher

For more help with this step, contact your Line Manager and your Tech Support team.

<a id="assured"></a>

### Assure

This step focuses on a technical and information assurance evaluation. This ensures that the technical characteristics, constraints and capabilities are understood. It also helps with on-going support and strategic planning. Successful completion of this step means that the OIT is added to the MOJ portfolio of tactical and operational tools.

Not all OITs progress through this step. However, it provides a greater level of assurance and therefore confidence.
