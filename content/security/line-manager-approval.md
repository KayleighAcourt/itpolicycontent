## Line Manager approval

<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

Some MOJ IT Policy documents require or recommend that approval is obtained from a Line Manager before taking an action or working in a particular way. Examples include:

- [Using your own smartphone, laptop, tablet or PC for work](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/using-your-own-smartphone-laptop-tablet-or-pc-for-work/)
- [Taking IT equipment abroad (business or personal)](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/taking-it-equipment-abroad-business-or-personal/)

This guidance describes the steps to perform in response to a request for Line Manager approval for something covered by MOJ IT Policy. The guidance contains information for [Line Managers](#steps-to-follow-line-managers), and their [Direct Reports](#steps-to-follow-direct-reports).

### Steps to follow (Line Managers)

> Note: If at _any_ time you require additional help or clarification about this approval process, or the applicable MOJ IT Policies, [ask for help](mailto:itpolicycontent+line-manager-approval@digital.justice.gov.uk?subject=line-manager-approval).

1. Check that your direct report (DR) has clearly identified what is wanted in their formal request for approval. The request should identify which MOJ IT Policies apply.
2. Check that the request is valid from a business perspective. If not, deny the request ([step 7](#step7) ).
3. Make sure that the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/acceptable-use/) is included in the list of applicable policies.
4. Review the requirements or obligations within those MOJ IT Policies.
5. Satisfy yourself that the DR understands and will comply with all the requirements or obligations. For example, you might have a discussion with them, or ask them to provide additional information or evidence.
6. If you are satisfied with their ability to comply with the applicable MOJ IT Policies, send a formal approval to the DR. An email is sufficient for this.
7. <a id="step7"></a>If you are not satisfied with their ability to comply with the Policies, or you feel that there is insufficient business case to support the request, send a formal refusal to the DR.
8. Keep a copy of your formal reply, in accord with Data Retention requirements.
9. Some MOJ IT Policies require a copy of formal approval to be sent to other parties. For example, before [travelling to some countries on MOJ business]((https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/taking-it-equipment-abroad-business-or-personal/)), a copy of the formal approval must be sent to Operational Security.

  - your request
  - the applicable MOJ IT Policies
  - evidence that you understand and can comply with the requirements or obligations
6. Be ready to have a more detailed discussion about your request, or to supply more information.
7. If you get formal approval, keep a copy, in accord with Data Retention requirements.
