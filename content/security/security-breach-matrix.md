<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

The MOJ takes security breaches very seriously. The Security Breach matrix helps you assess the seriousness of a breach. It helps ensure consistent assessment of the breach. It also helps you identify appropriate and proportionate actions to take in response. Actions could include a misconduct investigation.

A breach can occur in many ways, such as:

- emailing classified or delicate information to personal email accounts
- leaving papers for a meeting on public transport or in a coffee shop
- putting information carelessly onto a social-networking site

The matrix considers two important measures which apply to any breach:

1. The care or lack of care, on the horizontal axis.
2. The security classification of the asset and the impact of a compromise, on the vertical axis.

Evaluating the two measures produces a score. You assess the score, and decide whether to take informal or formal action. Some actions have a high score. Examples include serious neglect or reckless behaviour, especially involving classified information. The actions to take in response vary. A misconduct investigation might be appropriate, or a review of security clearance.

The matrix is a helpful and indicative tool, providing a useful guide. But it's not meant to be precise. Specific circumstances will vary. In practice, pragmatic judgement and flexibility helps ensure you reach an appropriate decision. Use the matrix as a starting point to consider the breach and decide on proportionate action. In general, the higher the score, the more likely you'll need help from MOJ Security or HR.

Not all breaches involve data or information. Examples include not escorting non-security cleared visitors, or losing a building pass.

Breach investigations should include a review of local practices. These help staff promote and ensure security and information management best practices.

The matrix table uses scoring for breaches involving classified information. The classification follows current Government Security Classification (GSC) guidance. Some breaches might involve information using the old Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). An example would be legacy information. If this applies, assess the information and decide which GSC tier is appropriate. You can then score the breach using the matrix. Seek advice where necessary from MOJ Security.

The final decision about what score applies for a breach lies with MOJ Security. This is to ensure consistency across the MOJ estate.

## Colour coding

Green scores (1-2) suggest a low severity security breach. It's unlikely that the breach needs formal action, such as discipline through HR. Informal action is most likely. This could include training and awareness, or managers reminding staff of their responsibilities. Managers should still consult MOJ Security about the individual circumstances of the case.

Discuss amber scores (3-4) with MOJ security. Breaches with these scores are likely to be instances of minor misconduct.

Consult MOJ Security before taking any action following a red score (5-8). Consider actions on a case-by-case basis. It's likely that the breach will need formal involvement with HR. MOJ security might take informal action, but again this is on a case-by-case basis.

Similarly, consult MOJ Security before taking any action following a black score (9-12). Consider actions on a case-by-case basis. Again, it's likely that the breach will need formal involvement with HR. MOJ security might take informal action, on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the nature of the breach, it might be necessary to involve the police.

## Examples to illustrate scoring

Please find below some examples of scoring (the list is not exhaustive):

Colour code | Score | Examples of corresponding security breach
------------|-------|------------------------------------------
Green | 1 | First instance of leaving `OFFICIAL` information insecure. First instance of losing or failing to display a building pass.
Green | 2 | Second instance of an incident that scored 1 before. Any instance of emailing `OFFICIAL` information to the wrong recipient.
Amber | 3 | Failing to follow management instructions after scoring 1 or 2. Poor treatment of classified information that might embarrass the MOJ. Loss of a MOJ warrant, ID card, PPE (?), MoE (?), or uniform. Loss or compromise of an MOJ port stamp (?).
Amber | 4 | First instance of leaving SECRET information insecure by accident.
Red | 5 | Second instance of scoring 4 within a rolling 12 month period. Deliberately reckless behaviour with `OFFICIAL` information. Intentional misuse of an MOJ asset such as warrant or building pass.
Red | 6 | First instance of careless handling of `SECRET` information.
Red | 7 | First instance of negligence with `SECRET` information. Examples include viewing it in a public place, losing documents, or allowing some other compromise.
Red | 8 | First instance of leaving `TOP SECRET` information insecure, by accident.
Black | 9 | Repeated instances of careless handling of `SECRET` information. This includes behaviour which might be criminal, but is not yet proven.
Black | 10 | First instance of carelessness with `TOP SECRET` information. This includes leaving it insecure or compromised. An example is taking information to a meeting in another government building, using an unsecured briefcase.
Black | 11 | Repeated instances of compromising `TOP SECRET` information. Examples include leaving it insecure, or failing to address spoken or written warnings about the behaviour.
Black | 12 | Evidence of possible criminal behaviour. For example, deliberate provision of `TOP SECRET` information to an unauthorised person.

### Example scenarios and resulting scores

Example 1: A security conscious member of staff loses a low impact `OFFICIAL` document on public transport. It appears to be avoidable but accidental carelessness. The risk is negligible. Score 1 or 2.

Example 2: A member of staff fails to collect an `OFFICIAL` document from a printer. The document was left insecure, and discovered during a breach patrol. This breach scores 1, rising to a 3 if the member of staff repeats this type of breach.

Example 3: A member of staff repeatedly fails to follow MOJ 'Clear Desk' policy. They leave `OFFICIAL` documents insecure, despite previous informal discussions about breaches of this kind. The first occurrence of this breach would score 1. Repeated behaviour, and failing to heed informal warnings, increases the score to 5.

Example 4: A member of staff emails the performance review of one of their direct reports to their personal email account. They intend to  access it from home, and so work on it in the evening. This contravenes MOJ policy and Information Management training taken by all staff. This shows almost total lack of care, and a high degree of negligence or recklessness. This breach would score 3.

Example 5: A member of staff fails to check that a cabinet is locked. The insecure cabinet contains `SECRET` information. This breach would score 4. If the member of staff is repeats this breach, the score rises to 6.

Example 6: A member of staff takes a `SECRET` document out of the office. They view the document while travelling on public transport. This breach would score 7.

Example 7: A member of staff leaves a `TOP SECRET` document on their desk while they go for lunch. This breach would score 8. Their line manager must consult with MOJ Security team before taking any action.

Example 8: A member of staff does not store `TOP SECRET` materials appropriately. Or, they dispatch the material without using a secure courier. This breach would score 10. Their line manager must consult with MOJ Security before taking any action.

Example 9: A member of staff gives a print out of a `TOP SECRET` document to someone who is not appropriately cleared to see the material. This breach would score 10. Their line manager must consult with MOJ Security before taking any action. It is possible that the police will become involved.

Example 10: A member of staff deliberately declassifies some `TOP SECRET` material. This breach would score 12. Their line manager must consult with MOJ Security before taking any action.

## Other factors to consider

In a hotdesk environment, it might be difficult to work out who was responsible for a breach. For example, anyone might use the space, and so cause the breach. In practice, the individual involved has the opportunity to explain the situation. They can highlight mitigating factors. Each instance is considered on a case-by-case basis.

Two aspects can help as mitigations:

- staff always follow the clear desk policy
- all output devices such as copiers are cleared at the end of each day

These aspects help prevent accusations of leaving classified information insecure.

Everyone is personally responsible for security. Line managers check their staff's approach and adherence. They then take action where appropriate. Looking at the actions taken is part of any breach investigation. If there are many breaches by more than one person in an area then MOJ Security would investigate. This would include reviewing manager actions, and escalating where appropriate.

In some cases, it might not be possible to identify who is responsible for a breach. The Head of the unit or business area will have to take responsibility. This is because they are responsible for ensuring the information held by their team is handled appropriately.

Even the most security conscious staff can make mistakes. Concentration can be affected by a range of factors. There are specific HR procedures to follow in all cases where serious breaches occur. Individuals have the opportunity to put forward any mitigating factors during this process. Each case is considered on its individual merits.
