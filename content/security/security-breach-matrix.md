<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

The MOJ takes security breaches very seriously. The Security Breach matrix helps you assess the seriousness of a breach. It helps ensure consistent assessment of the breach. It also helps you identify appropriate and proportionate actions to take in response. Actions could include a misconduct investigation.

A breach can occur in many ways, such as:

- emailing classified or delicate information to personal email accounts
- leaving papers for a meeting on public transport or in a coffee shop
- putting information carelessly onto a social-networking site

The matrix considers two important measures which apply to any breach:

1. The care or lack of care, on the horizontal axis.
2. The security classification of the asset and the impact of a  compromise, on the vertical axis.

Evaluating the two measures produces a score. You assess the score, and decide whether to take informal or formal action. Some actions  score highly. Examples include serious neglect or reckless behaviour, especially involving highly classified information. The actions to take in response vary. A misconduct investigation might be appropriate, or a review of security clearance.

The matrix is a helpful and indicative tool, providing a useful guide. But it's not meant to be precise. Specific circumstances will vary. In practice, pragmatic judgement and flexibility helps ensure you reach an appropriate decision.  Use the matrix as a starting point to consider the breach and decide on proportionate action. In general, the higher the score, the more likely you'll need help from MOJ Security and perhaps HR.

Not all breaches involve data or information. Examples include not escorting non-security cleared visitors properly, or losing a building pass.

Breach investigations should include a review of local practices. These help staff promote and ensure security and information management best practices.

The matrix table uses scoring for breaches involving classified information. The classification follows current Government Security Classification (GSC) guidance. Some breaches might involve information using the old Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). An example would be legacy information. If this applies, assess the information and decide which GSC tier is appropriate. You can then score the breach using the matrix. Seek advice where necessary from MOJ Security.

## Colour coding

Green scores (1-2) suggest a low severity security breach. The breach probably doesn't need formal action, such as discipline through HR. Informal action is most likely. This could include training and awareness, or managers reminding staff of their responsibilities. Managers should still consult MOJ Security about the individual circumstances of the case.

## Examples to illustrate scoring

Please find below some examples of scoring (the list is not exhaustive):

Green		Scores 1-2
First instance of leaving classified (OFFICIAL) information insecure. First instance of losing or failing to display a building pass.
Second instance of an incident that scored 1 before.
Any instance of emailing classified (OFFICIAL) information to the wrong recipient.

Amber	Scores 3-4
Repeated failure to heed management instructions from issues 1-2 above, resulting in behaviour almost guaranteed to bring the Home Office embarrassment because of implications with respect to poor treatment of classified information.  Or, loss of a HO warrant/ID card/PPE/MoE/uniform.  Loss/compromise of a HO port stamp.
First occasion of leaving SECRET information unsecure due to pure oversight.

Consult with Home Office Security before any action is taken.  Scores in the Amber region (scores 3-4) of the matrix could be considered as minor misconduct, potential Home Office Security, resulting in, for example, the member of staff being referred to the Aftercare Team.


Red		Scores 5-8
Second occasion of 4 within a rolling 12 month period.  Behaviour that is considered deliberately reckless with OFFICIAL information or intentional misuse of a HO asset such as warrant/building pass.
First occasion of high degree of carelessness shown in handling of SECRET information.
First occasion of high degree of negligence with SECRET information including reviewing in a public place, losing documents and/or otherwise allowing compromise.
First occasion of leaving TOP SECRET or STRAP information unsecure due to pure oversight.

Consult with Home Office Security immediately before any action is taken.   Action taken for scores in the Red region (scores 5-8) will be considered on a case by case basis, but it is highly likely that formal action through HR will be taken.  Informal action will also most likely be taken forward by Home Office Security, but again will be considered on a case by case basis.



Black		Scores 9-12
Repeated occasions of careless handling of SECRET information, including behaviour which is considered potentially criminal (but not yet proven)
First occasion of leaving unsecure or otherwise compromising TOP SECRET or STRAP information in circumstances of great carelessness.  For example, taking information to a meeting in another government building using an unsecured briefcase.
Repeated occasions of leaving unsecure or otherwise compromising TOP SECRET or STRAP information and failure to address any spoken or written warning about this behaviour.
Possible criminal behaviour evidenced.  For example deliberate provision of TOP SECRET or STRAP information to an unauthorised person.

Consult with Home Office Security immediately before any action is taken.   Action taken for scores in the Black region (scores 9-12) will be considered on a case by case basis, but it is highly likely that formal action through HR will be taken.  Informal action will also be taken forward by Home Office Security, but again will be considered on a case by case basis.  Any breach involving STRAP material must be reported immediately to the Home Office STRAPSO team in Home Office Security.

Dependent on the nature of the breach, the police may also be involved.





The final decision as to what score is awarded following a breach lies with Home Office Security as the breach policy lead and to ensure consistency across the Home Office estate.

Below are some breach examples and possible scores:


Example 1: a member of staff who is normally security conscious loses a low impact OFFICIAL document on public transport – you may consider this to be carelessness which could have been avoided, but if the risk overall is negligible: score 1 or 2.

Example 2: a member of staff fails to collect an OFFICIAL document from a printer.  The document is left unsecure and discovered during a breach patrol.  This breach would score a 1, rising to a 3 if the member of staff is continually responsible for this type of breach.

Example 3: a member of staff repeatedly does not comply with Home Office ‘Clear Desk policy’ leaving OFFICIAL documents unsecure, despite having been subject to previous informal discussions with regards to a breach of this nature.  For a first occurrence of this breach a score of 1 would be awarded, but as this is repeated behaviour and the member of staff has been spoken to about this, the score would increase to a 5.

Example 4: a member of staff emails the PDR of one of their direct reports to their personal email account so that they can access it from home and work on it in the evening.  This contravenes Home Office policy and Information management training taken by all staff, so would therefore be considered an almost total lack of care; high degree of negligence and/or recklessness.  This breach would score a 3.

Example 5: a cabinet is found unsecure containing SECRET information after a member of staff fails to check it is properly locked.  This breach would score a 4, rising to a 6 if the member of staff is continually responsible for this type of breach.

Example 6: a member of staff takes a SECRET document out of the office and views it whilst on public transport.  This breach would score a 7.

Example 7: a member of staff leaves a classified STRAP document on their desk while they go for lunch.  This breach would score an 8.  As a line manager, you must consult the Home Office Security STRAPSO team before taking any action.

Example 8: a member of staff does not store STRAP materials appropriately or dispatches material not using a secure courier.  This breach would score a 10.  As a line manager, you must consult the Home Office Security STRAPSO team before taking any action.

Example 9: a member of staff gives a hard copy STRAP document to someone who is not appropriately cleared to see the material.  This breach would score a 10.  As a line manager, you must consult the Home Office Security STRAPSO team before taking any action.

Example 10:  Deliberate declassification of STRAP material by a member of staff.  This breach would score a 12.  As a line manager, you must consult the Home Office Security STRAPSO team before taking any action.




Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

How do we confirm the owner of a breach, especially where flexible desk sharing occurs?  The individual could contend that someone else must have caused the breach.
	
The individual concerned will have the opportunity to explain the situation, advancing any mitigating factors.  Each instance will be considered on a case by case basis.  The key message here is that if a staff member is known to adhere robustly to a clear desk policy and where a system is in place to ensure all photocopiers, printers etc are cleared at the end of the day, this clearly strengthens any argument that they themselves did not leave classified information unsecure.

Will line managers be penalised if their staff continue to breach security?  If so, under what circumstances?
	
All staff are personally responsible for security, but managers will be expected to monitor their staff’s approach and adherence and to take action where appropriate: whether they have done this will be part of any breach investigation. Certainly, if there were a number of breaches by more than one person in one area then Home Office Security would want to explore the efforts made by managers and might decide to escalate their findings if they were seriously concerned.

All breaches are investigated on a case by case basis.  If an individual cannot be identified as being responsible for the breach, but a business area is, Home Office Security will expect the Head of Unit to take responsibility for the breach.  They are ultimately responsible for ensuring the information held by their team is appropriately handled.

What support will be available for those who may be suffering from stress or a medical condition that may have contributed to a momentary oversight and/or a more serious security breach?
	
We recognise that even the most security conscious staff can make mistakes and that concentration can be affected by a range of factors.  There are specific HR procedures that will have to be followed in all cases where serious breaches occur.  Staff members will obviously have the opportunity to put forward any mitigating factors during this process.  Each case will be considered on its individual merits.

Annex A


Some information which was previously marked CONFIDENTIAL under the Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS) converges into the new SECRET classification under the Government Security Classifications (GSC).

The current IT infrastructure does not provide the appropriate level of protection to defend against the threat profile for GSC SECRET. Therefore, whilst a new SECRET system is being developed to address this capability gap, the use of GPMS CONFIDENTIAL has remained as an interim measure.

To remain consistent and ensure staff are treated fairly and to the same standards, any breaches involving information at interim CONFIDENTIAL will be scored the same as legacy information using the breach matrix.  Under GSC this information would fall into the SECRET tier and therefore should be scored as SECRET.   Any information which does not meet the threshold for SECRET is now OFFICIAL and should be treated as such.
