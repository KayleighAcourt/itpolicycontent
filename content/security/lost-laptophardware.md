<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

## What to do if your device is lost, stolen, or compromised

> Note: You can help reduce problems by making sure that devices used for MOJ tasks are always shut down before leaving Government premises. Locking a laptop, or 'putting it to sleep' is not completely secure. A lost or stolen laptop can be accessed more easily if it is only locked or sleeping. A shut down makes sure that all security measures are in place, such as full disk encryption.

If you think your device is lost, stolen, 'hacked', or in some way compromised, you must:

- tell your line manager straight away
- for a lost or stolen device, contact the Police and make sure you get the incident reference number
- contact the Service Desk; the analyst will ask the relevant questions and note responses on the ticket
  - the contact telephone number you need is Technology Service Desk:<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2017/12/74015bc20bb1c38fb4249c4ef6d3cfed.gif) &nbsp;<br/>or if calling from overseas:<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2018/05/8fc27c901ed47aa9d7edcb8ff4121e66.gif)&nbsp;
- when back online fill in a [security incident form](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/)
- email the form to:<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2017/12/e6404c31d65821489a775401ce4b941d.gif) &nbsp;

If MOJ data or information is lost or compromised, [report it as a data loss](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/report-a-data-loss/).
