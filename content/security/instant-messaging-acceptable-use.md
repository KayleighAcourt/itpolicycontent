<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

Instant messaging is a variation of email. It's quick and simple, making it an important way of working for everyone at the MOJ. The main difference is that you can send and receive messages 'instantly'. This lets you have interactive conversations.

Instant messages include information such as:

- text
- links to websites
- images
- emojis
- calls
- videos
- attachments such as files

Remember that, like email, instant messages are part of your work, and that the MOJ monitors them. Messages are subject to Freedom of Information, data retention, and privacy considerations.

Instant messaging tools include [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/), [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/), [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), and some others. This document applies to all instant messaging within the MOJ.

You must use IM in an acceptable way. This guidance provides extra points to bear in mind when using IM. Start by reviewing the general information in the MOJ Acceptable Use guidance, [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/acceptable-use/).

## Classified information

In general, you can use IM for `OFFICIAL` and `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information. Most IM systems are not approved for the higher classifications: `SECRET` or `TOP SECRET`. Some IM systems such as Rosa are MOJ- or government-specific. They might be approved for use with higher classification information.

Avoid using IM to share or discuss operational information. Examples include:

- configuration details
- personnel or HR information
- log file content
- details of legal cases
- MOJ security investigations
- MOJ system vulnerabilities

You can't use IM for all `OFFICIAL` information. For example, some commercial or proprietary information might not have a high classification. But you shouldn't discuss it using IM.

## Avoid embarrassment

IM messages can go to individuals or groups, so think before you send them. If a message would cause problems, upset, offence, or embarrassment, it's not acceptable. Remember that the work discussions can become public in the future. This might include IM messages and conversations.

You shouldn't discuss personal information about other people using IM without their knowledge. You might choose to discuss a personal medical issue with your line manager. But your line manager wouldn't start a conversation with you about a medical issue.

Context is important:
- think about who might be looking over your shoulder reading the messages
- think about what people on a video call might see behind you, or hear on a conference call

## Securing your instant messaging account

Improve the security of your IM tools by using 2-factor authentication (2FA).

2FA requires you to supply more information when you use your account. This extra information is usually one of:

- a unique code sent to your mobile device
- a frequently-changing code generated by an authentication device or app

Find 2FA details for the more popular IM tools here:

- Skype supports 2FA through the associated [Office 365 account](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-users-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6)
- Slack [support for 2FA](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication)
- Telegram [support for 2FA](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-does-2-step-verification-work)
- WhatsApp [support for 2FA](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000021/)
- Yammer supports 2FA through the associated [Office 365 account](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-users-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6)

## Do's

- always identify yourself and your organisation
- access the IM system using:
  - the official application
  - a standard web browser

## ...and Don'ts

- don't post anonymously
- don't share personal information about your colleagues without their permission
- don't rely on IM tools to be available all the time

## Summary

- only post information at the appropriate security classification for the IM system
- use common sense to help you decide what can be in an instant message
- be guided by the [Civil Service Code][csc].
- if you're not sure if something's acceptable, ask for help first
- if you think there's a problem, [report it](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/)
