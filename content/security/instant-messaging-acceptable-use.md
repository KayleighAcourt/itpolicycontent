## Instant messaging acceptable use

<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

Instant messaging is a variation of email. The main difference is that you can send and receive messages 'instantly'. This lets you have interactive conversations.

Instant messaging is quick and simple, making it an important way of working for everyone at the MOJ. Instant messaging tools include [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/), [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/), and some others. This document refers to Slack, but applies to all instant messaging within the MOJ.

You must use Slack in an acceptable way. This guidance explains what that means. Start by reviewing the general information in the MOJ Acceptable Use guidance, [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/acceptable-use/).

Here are some extra points to bear in mind when using Slack:

- always identify yourself and your organisation; don't post anonymously
- messages might include information such as:
  - text
  - links to websites
  - images
  - emojis
  - calls
  - videos
- messages can go to individuals or groups, so think before you send them. If a message would cause problems, upset, offence, or embarrassment, it's not acceptable
- messages are part of your work. This makes them subject to Freedom of Information, data retention, and privacy considerations
- the MOJ monitors messages
- context is important:
  - think about who might be looking over your shoulder reading the messages
  - think about what people on a video call might see behind you, or hear on a conference call

Finally, remember:

- if you're not sure if something is acceptable, ask for help first
- above all, if you think there is a problem, [report it](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/)
