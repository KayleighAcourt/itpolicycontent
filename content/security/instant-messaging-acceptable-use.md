<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

Instant messaging is a variation of email. It's quick and simple, making it an important way of working for everyone at the MOJ. The main difference is that you can send and receive messages 'instantly'. This lets you have interactive conversations.

Instant messages include information such as:

  - text
  - links to websites
  - images
  - emojis
  - calls
  - videos

Instant messaging tools include [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/), [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/), and some others. This document refers to Slack, but applies to all instant messaging within the MOJ.

Remember that, like email, instant messages are part of your work. The MOJ monitors messages. Messages are subject to Freedom of Information, data retention, and privacy considerations.

You must use Slack in an acceptable way. This guidance provides extra points to bear in mind when using Slack. Start by reviewing the general information in the MOJ Acceptable Use guidance, [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/acceptable-use/).

## Classified information

You can use Slack for `OFFICIAL` and `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information. It is not approved for the higher classifications: `SECRET` or `TOP SECRET`. Don't share or discuss operational information on Slack. Other examples to avoid include details of cases, investigations or system vulnerabilities.

You can't use Slack for all `OFFICIAL` information. For example, some commercial or proprietary information might not have a high classification. But you shouldn't discuss it on Slack.

Use common sense to help you decide what can be in an instant message. Be guided by the [Civil Service Code][csc].

## Avoid embarrassment

In Slack, messages can go to individuals or groups, so think before you send them. If a message would cause problems, upset, offence, or embarrassment, it's not acceptable. Remember that the work discussions can become public in the future. This might include Slack messages and conversations.

Context is important:
- think about who might be looking over your shoulder reading the messages
- think about what people on a video call might see behind you, or hear on a conference call

## Securing your instant messaging account

Turn on 2-factor authentication (2FA) for your account

- Skype supports 2FA through the associated [Office 365 account](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-users-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6)
- Slack [supports 2FA](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) within the account
- Yammer supports 2FA through the associated [Office 365 account](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-users-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6)

## Do's

- always identify yourself and your organisation
- access the Slack system using:
  - the official application
  - a standard web browser

### ...and Don'ts

- don't post anonymously
- don't share personal information about your colleagues without their permission

### And finally...

- if you're not sure if something is acceptable, ask for help first
- if you think there is a problem, [report it](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/)
