## Overview

Open Internet Tools (OITs) are applications or services from suppliers outside the MOJ. They often have the following characteristics:

- they are general purpose. This means they are not specific to the MOJ. Other organisations can use them
- they are accessed using the Internet. This means that if you have Internet access, you can connect to the tools
- they often have a basic 'free-to-use' version. This means that you can use some or all the capabilities, but with some constraints. For example, an online word-processor might limit you to 5 documents in your account
- they often have one or more 'paid for' versions. By paying for the tool, you unlock some or all the constraints

### Quick checklist

To help you decide if you can use an OIT to work on an MOJ task, consider the following questions:

- is the task information subject to specific rules or requirements in your part of the MOJ?
- is the task information classified as anything other than `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE`?
- does the task information include any data identifiable as being about someone?
- is this the first time anyone has used the tool for MOJ business?
- could there be damaging consequences if the task information you work with using the tool is:
  - lost
  - stolen
  - published in the media

If the answer to _any_ of these questions is 'Yes', get guidance from your Line Manager, _before_ using the OIT.

### Why OITs are an opportunity

OITs offer some significant advantages for you and the MOJ, including:

- enabling you to work the way you want to, more effectively
- usually cheaper than buying or building and supporting a dedicated tool
- no need to build or support the tool
- good use of open standards, such as file formats
- reduced need to have specific hardware or software on computers
- rapid patching to address security issues
- easy updating as new features are deployed
- a large pool of help and support
- easy access, whenever you have a network connection
- increasing availability of some or all capabilities when disconnected from the network

### Why OITs are a risk

OITs also pose some threats or risks, including:

- dependency on the tool and supplier
- security of access to the tool
- security of information stored within or processed by the tool
- potential difficulty of enhancing or customising the tool for MOJ-specific requirements

But as long you consider the threats or risks, and address them, OITS provide many benefits for you and the MOJ.

### Summary

With careful use, OITs help you to work more effectively and efficiently. Think about them as serious and preferable options for performing tasks.

## Using OITs

This guidance helps you:

- understand the conditions or constraints that apply to a tool, or a task performed using a tool
- identify and address threats or risks posed by a new tool
- understand what tools are available for you to use
- identify and champion new tools that might benefit the MOJ

### Privacy and personal information

Data protection legislation makes you responsible for personal information you work with. You must keep it safe and secure.

Without advance consent from anyone affected, don't use OITs for storing personal data. Never use OITs if unlawful disclosure of the information they process might cause damage or distress to an individual.

Data protection legislation might also limit _where_ you can process personal data. An OIT should have a privacy statement that describes where it stores or processes data. Be ready to contact the OIT provider for more information about this aspect of their service.

Be sure you can fulfil your data protection responsibilities when using an OIT. It might be helpful to complete a [Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/privacy-impact-assessments/).

Complying with personal information requirements can be complex. Don't hesitate to ask for advice:<br/>

### Classification and security

An OIT can only store or process information [classified](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) at `OFFICIAL` level.

Think about the MOJ information you work with.  What would happen if you lost it, or it's stolen, or published in the media? Suppose the information was overheard in a cafe, or read from your screen on a crowded train. Could there be damaging consequences? If the answer is 'No', then it's probably OK to use OITs to store or send that information.

Think also about information moving across the Internet. The data might be safe within the MOJ and in an approved OIT. But what about the connection between the two? Sending information might involve insecure networks. Be aware of the security implications. Check that enough suitable security measures are in place to protect the information. For example, check for encryption of network connections using [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). A simple way to do this is to look for the secure connection indicator in your web browser:<br/>
![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2018/02/guidance-for-using-open-internet-tools-01.png)

You have a duty of confidentiality and a responsibility to safeguard any HMG information or data that you access. This is [Principle 2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) of the Government Security Classifications. The MOJ trusts you to work with `OFFICIAL` information. In the same way, you're trusted to make a reasoned judgement about whether it's safe to use an OIT.

Useful help for deciding what is OK is in [existing social media guidance](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/11/social-media-policy-guidance.pdf). While it's more about how to act online, the principles are helpful for OITs.

Remember that it is impossible to delete information after it's released in public.

For more information about MOJ IT Security, look on the MOJ Intranet [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/).

### Storage and data retention

Laws and regulations make the MOJ and its employees responsible for managing information. Some examples include:

- the Freedom of Information Act
- the Data Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulation
- the Public Records Acts

When we receive a request for information, we need to know where we hold all the relevant information. Storing business information on appropriate MOJ systems helps us, because:

- it protects us by making it easy to provide evidence of why decisions were made
- it helps everyone understand what information is held, and where to find it
- it enables the MOJ to transfer policy and court records to The National Archives

Always store MOJ information in MOJ systems. If you use an OIT, make sure the key information is also stored in an appropriate MOJ system. Guidance on what you must keep is available [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/managing-information/what-to-keep/). At regular and convenient intervals, transfer the information to an appropriate MOJ system. Do the same when you finish the work. Don't forget to remove any redundant information from the OIT.

Most OITs let you export your data. You can then store it on an appropriate MOJ system. Sometimes it's easier to copy and paste text into a new document. Make sure that only the correct people have access to the information. This is important after staff or organisational changes, for example.

For more guidance, read the [MOJ Information Management Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/04/information-management-policy.pdf). There is also help on [responding to requests for information](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/providing-information-to-the-public/freedom-of-information/).

### Service and support

OITs are often intuitive and reliable. But that doesn't mean they are always available and always work as you expect. The MOJ can't provide technical support or ensure service availability for them. Always have another way of working if the OIT is not available for some reason or for any length of time. In other words, don't let an OIT become business critical.

Check the OIT usage agreement to find out more about the service and support available.

## Common OITs

There are already many OITs used across the MOJ. Permission to use an OIT might vary, depending on where you work in the MOJ. For example, some teams must not access or use some OITs, for security or operational reasons.

It's always a good idea to let your Line Manager know you are planning to use an OIT for your work.

A current list of OITs, and their status, is available [here][oitlist].

## Identifying and championing new tools

New OITs are being developed all the time. Some of these might be better suited for the tasks you need to perform. They might provide a solution that didn't exist before. It's helpful to know how to identify and champion a new OIT. The benefit is that it becomes allowed within the MOJ.

The basic process consists of four steps.

1. [Definition](#definition), leading to Prototype.
2. [Alpha](#alpha), leading to Acceptance.
3. [Beta](#beta), leading to Approved.
4. [Gamma](#gamma), leading to Assured.

The four steps encourage and enable adoption of new OITs. You have an essential role to play in the process. If you get blocked in a steps, it might mean an earlier step was not completed successfully or correctly.

Your role is essential because you are championing the new OIT. It may well be that others join you and help advocate for the new tool. But you are the one who spotted the potential of a  OIT to help you in your work, and to help others in their work. During the evaluation of an OIT, you're the natural focus point for status information. This includes monitoring progress through Acceptance, Approval, and Assurance testing. You might have to deal with various 'housekeeping' activities, such as:

- help organise installation or deployment
- grant access to the OIT functionality
- remove access from the OIT
- co-ordinate with other system teams within the MOJ
- create a process for saving material from the OIT into a corporate system
- work out what information or tasks the OIT is suitable for
- identifying other champions for the OIT

... as well as many other related responsibilities.

If this list seems burdensome, ask yourself if the OIT is worth the effort or not.

Without a specific individual being responsible, these activities can get overlooked. In time, this can cause difficulties such as ambiguity about the OITs approval status.

It's important that there's always a champion when a tool is critical to the business unit. Often, when the tool is first used, someone sets up an account and grants others access to that account. If the account holder leaves, access control might become difficult or even impossible. Solving problems of this kind for tools that are not recognised or supported by MOJ technology can be very difficult.

<a id="definition"></a>

### Definition

During the Definition stage, you describe and confirm the business need. Describe example tasks, and why they are good representatives of other tasks.

Next, show why the existing tools cannot meet that the business need.

You can now work to identify a suitable OIT. It must solve the business need, or provide significant help in fulfilling it. The OIT should work in a way that aligns with and promotes MOJ principles and objectives. You might also learn of a new tool from across Government, or through professional bodies.

When you have an OIT in mind, you can investigate the characteristics of the tool. Ask fundamental questions, such as:

- is the tool suitable for general information at `OFFICIAL` classification?
- is the tool compatible with legislative obligations, such as:
    - complying with data protection legislation
    - protecting and deleting information in accord with data retention requirements
    - providing features that support Freedom of Information requests
- what is the cost to try out the tool? What pricing model applies for more extensive or formal use?
- what are the licensing requirements?
- what are the hardware, software, and other operational requirements?
- how is information within the tool kept secure?
- how compatible is the tool with other, existing approved tools within the MOJ?

At the end of this stage, you should have a clear idea of:

- the specific task you want the OIT to perform
- the general tasks the OIT could perform
- the resources needed to use the OIT:
  - on your allocated IT equipment
  - on the wider MOJ IT infrastructure and staff
- the security characteristics of the OIT

With these answers ready, you can seek permission to prototype the tool for performing the task. Do this by contacting your Line Manager and your Tech Support team, so that they know what your plan is and that you have approval to prototype.

<a id="alpha"></a>

### Alpha

During this step, you use the prototype tool to perform the task. Take plenty of notes about how easy it is to configure and use the tool. While focusing on the main task, consider 'edge cases' or unusual scenarios where the tool might not be so successful.

At the end of the task, you should have collected enough evidence to show that:

- the OIT aligns with MOJ good practice and obligations
- it is capable of performing tasks for others within the MOJ
- is it cost-effective

In summary, you have collected material to help justify more serious consideration: acceptance.

For more help with the Alpha step, contact your Line Manager and your Tech Support team.

<a id="beta"></a>

### Beta

During the [Alpha](#alpha) step, you showed that the OIT is capable of performing tasks to advance MOJ business, and to do so in a way that aligns with MOJ good practice and obligations. However, you were almost certainly using the OIT in evaluation mode. Perhaps not all functions were available. Or they were limited to a small number of components or data sets.

The Beta step focuses on getting the tool recognised as Approved for use within the MOJ. This typically requires funding, technical support, and more formal evaluation within a Triage process. The process is based on the Project Triage process, described [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/it-services/approvals-to-spend/).

For more help with the Beta step, contact your Line Manager and your Tech Support team.

<a id="gamma"></a>

### Gamma

The Gamma step focuses on a technical and information assurance evaluation. This is to help ensure that the technical characteristics, constraints and capabilities are fully understood. This helps with on-going support and strategic planning, now that the OIT is being added to the portfolio of tactical and operational tools.

Not all OITs progress through the Gamma step. However, it provides a greater level of assurance and therefore confidence.

For more help with the Gamma step, contact your Line Manager and your Tech Support team.
