<b>This information applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

## Important note

Open Internet Tools (OITs) are applications or services from suppliers outside the MOJ. When using an OIT, ensure you address privacy and personal information considerations. In particular:

- you must follow data protection obligations
- don't use OITs if unlawful disclosure of the information they process might cause damage or distress

More information about OITs and privacy and personal information is available [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/guidance-for-using-open-internet-tools/#privacy-and-personal-information).

## Overview

This information describes the current status of Open Internet Tools (OITs) within the MOJ.

There are already many OITs used across the MOJ. Permission to use an OIT might vary, depending on where you work in the MOJ. For example, some teams must not access or use some OITs, for security or operational reasons. More detailed guidance on the use of OITs is available [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/guidance-for-using-open-internet-tools/).

## Assured, approved, or acceptable

OITs are often described as being: acceptable, approved, or assured.

*Acceptable* means that the OIT has not been tested. No review has been done of the available information about the OIT. Other people within the MOJ might be using the OIT, and have not reported any problems. It should be OK to use the tool with `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information. When you use the OIT, think about any consequences of information disclosure.

*Approved* means that the OIT has not been tested. A review of the available information about the OIT has taken place, but didn't find any obvious problems. It should be OK to use the tool with `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information.

*Assured* means that the OIT has been tested. No specific problems were found that would prevent you from using the tool with `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information.

Always check with your [Line Manager](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/line-manager-approval/) if you are thinking of using an OIT for your work. Do this _before_ you start the work.
