## Why?  

The majority of HMG information is now classified as OFFICIAL and, as per HMG policy, will not carry any marking.  However, unless the sensitivity of the information would be obvious to the recipients, documents should carry handling instructions on the first page.   Any OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE information should be labelled as such.  If you think your information should be marked OFFICIAL – SENSITIVE please speak to a member of the MoJ Digital IA Team first as this descriptor should be used appropriately.

OFFICIAL information must only be shared on a need-to-know basis.  Interpretation of the need-to-know will depend on the content.  OFFICIAL information in the public domain has a very different distribution profile to a contract document or document containing sensitive personal information.

## Source

These guidelines are based on “The Government Security Classification (GSC)” as issued by the Cabinet Office in 2018:

Where appropriate they have been expanded to reference the systems generally available to Authority suppliers.
