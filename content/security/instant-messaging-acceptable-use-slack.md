<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

Instant messaging is the near real-time exchange of electronic messages. It's quick and simple, making it an important way of working for everyone at the MOJ. The main difference is that you send and receive messages 'instantly'. This lets you have interactive conversations. [Slack](https://slack.com/) is a powerful instant messaging tool used within the MOJ.

Remember that, as with email, Slack messages and activities are part of your work, and that the MOJ monitors them. Messages are subject to Freedom of Information, data retention, and privacy considerations.

You must use Slack in an acceptable way. This document provides guidance and best practices for using Slack in your work. Start by reviewing the general information in the MOJ Acceptable Use guidance, [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/acceptable-use/).

## Key points about Slack

As well as messages, Slack supports workflow and process management, and connections with other MOJ tools.

Slack messages include information, multimedia content and attachments such as:

- text
- links to websites
- images
- emojis
- calls
- videos
- files

Messages are created and delivered in channels. Channels are identified using hash names, for example `#chat` or `#security`. Channels can be public or private. A public channel in an organisation can be seen by anyone. You need an invitation before you can see a private channel. If you can see a channel, you can see any of the messages within that channel.

As an MOJ resource, anything and everything you put into Slack is potentially public and subject to Freedom-of-Information requests.

## Classified information

You can use Slack only for `OFFICIAL` information. This includes information with the `SENSITIVE` handling caveat. Slack is not approved for the higher classifications: `SECRET` or `TOP SECRET`.

Don't use Slack to share material with extra information management or privacy requirements. Examples include:

- passwords and other data we should keep private
- personnel or HR information
- personal data that is not your own
- details of legal cases
- commercial or proprietary information under enhanced confidentiality, such as Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)

## Information management and record keeping

Slack is designed for near real-time communication. The steady flow of messages in a channel might make it difficult to find individual messages later, such as who made a decision. But as an official MOJ communications tool, messages in Slack are subject to Freedom-of-Information requests, and must be kept and managed in accordance with MOJ [information management and retention policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/).

This is especially important for discussions you have to keep. Examples include key decisions or incident timelines. Consider copying or archiving the conversations.

## Avoid embarrassment

Slack messages might go through channels to individuals or groups. Think before you send them. If a message might cause problems, upset, offence, or embarrassment, it's not acceptable. Remember that the work discussions might become public in the future. This includes Slack messages and conversations.

You shouldn't discuss personal information about other people using Slack, without their knowledge. For example, you might choose to discuss a personal medical issue of your own with your line manager. But your line manager wouldn't start a detailed conversation in Slack with you about a medical issue you have.

Context is important:

- think about who might be looking over your shoulder reading the messages
- think about what people on a video call might see behind you, or hear on a conference call

## Invitations

<!-- (Review and revise this based on what Okta does and permits.) -->

Slack makes it easy to 'invite' people to join your conversations. This might be fine for MOJ colleagues, but avoid giving invites to external people. Once someone has access to a Slack channel, it's hard to know what else they might access using the tool.

## Securing your instant messaging account

<!-- (Review and revise this based on what Okta does and permits.) -->

Improve the security of your IM tools by using 2-factor authentication (2FA). The NCSC says that "[2FA is the single best thing you can do to improve the security of your important accounts](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/two-factor-authentication-2fa-new-guidance-ncsc)". They provide more detailed guidance on setting up 2FA [here](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

In summary, 2FA requires you to supply more information when you use your account. Examples of extra information include:

- a unique code sent to your mobile device
- a frequently-changing code generated by an authentication device or app
- the presence of a uniquely identifiable hardware device

## Do's

- always identify yourself and your organisation
- access Slack using:
  - the official application
  - a standard web browser
- use 2FA <!-- (Okta dependent) -->

## ...and Don'ts

- don't share personal information about your colleagues without their permission
- don't rely on Slack to be available all the time

## Summary

- only post `OFFICIAL` or `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` information
- use common sense to help you decide what is acceptable in an instant message
- be guided by the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code/)
- if you're not sure if something's acceptable, ask for help first
- if you think there's a problem, [report it](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/)
