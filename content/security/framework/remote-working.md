### Who does it apply to?

Any remote working User of the [ORGANISATION] ICT systems.

This document is designed to help Users of computing facilities, (e.g. laptop computer or personal digital assistant), within the [ORGANISATION] to access [ORGANISATION] ICT systems in a secure manner. This document applies to all staff including contractors, casuals and service providers, who use computing equipment, provided by the [ORGANISATION] for remote working or mobile computing, or process any departmental information while working remotely or while using mobile computing equipment.

It also sets out Users' individual responsibilities for IT security when using remote working and mobile computing facilities. Everyone accessing [ORGANISATION] ICT systems from remote locations must follow these procedures.

Members of the judiciary who use computer facilities provided by the [ORGANISATION] for remote or mobile working may also find this guide useful but should additionally refer to any separate security guidance provided for the judiciary.

### When and how should these procedures be used?

Users' Security Awareness training will cover these procedures.

In this guide remote working means any working away from the office using computers and telecommunications technologies, whether this is from home, another [ORGANISATION] or government office, whilst travelling, at conferences, or in hotels.

Users should read this document prior to using any [ORGANISATION] ICT Systems for the first time, and revisit it every six (6) months to remind themselves of the procedures. Regular audits will check that these procedures are being followed. Remote working users should also be compliant with:

- System User Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs).

Users must understand that they are responsible for maintaining the security of [ORGANISATION] systems, and that failure to comply with these SyOPs could lead to compromise of the [ORGANISATION]'s infrastructure or even the entire GSI. Users must note further that either failure to comply with this SyOPs or failure to return the security sign off form would be considered a breach of the [ORGANISATION] [IT Security Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/ict-security-policy/).

For other security related information, please refer to:

<li>Users must prevent unauthorised access to official information from other members of their household and guard against accidental access by visitors by keeping the laptop under lock and key, and out of sight.</li>

<li>Users must not reconfigure, or attempt to reconfigure, their laptop to access any network other than the departmental system.</li>
