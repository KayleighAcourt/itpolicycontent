<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

General information about the security vetting and clearance process is available on the GOV.UK site, [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/security-vetting-and-clearance).

Information specific to the MOJ is available on the Intranet. While it refers to pre-employment vetting and clearance, it applies to anyone who needs a new or changed clearance. The two main articles are:

- [Personnel security prior to employment](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/staff-security-and-responsibilities/personnel-security-prior-to-employment/)
- [National Security Vetting Contact](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/recruitment/security-vetting/vetting-contact-point-vcp/)

From June 1st, 2018, there is a new National Security Vetting Process:
