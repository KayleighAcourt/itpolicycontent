<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

## Overview

This guide helps you protect MOJ data and information. It uses the terms 'data' and 'information' interchangeably.

The [HMG Security Policy Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework/hmg-security-policy-framework) makes clear that:

> The security of information is essential to good government and public confidence.

This places obligations on all parts of the MOJ. The obligations usually come from legislation, such as the Data Protection Act or Freedom of Information Act. Meeting the obligations means that where information is shared for business purposes, the MOJ ensures that the receiving party understands the obligations, and assures asset protection appropriately.

Failing to comply with security policies and guidance such as this document might result in disciplinary or even criminal penalties. Having appropriate business structures and processes in place helps ensure proper handling, control and - where appropriate - managed disclosure of assets.

To help you maintain security of information when sharing or transmitting date, this guide tells you about:

- essential data protection or privacy issues
- things to think about when getting data moved or copied from one system to another

This guide also helps you with what to do if something has gone wrong:

- dealing with data incidents

### Scope

The MoJ Central Information Assurance (IA) team provide general guidance on the handling of protectively marked data, whilst this document concentrates on providing guidance on information stored on MoJ ICT systems and exchanged electronically within the MoJ and with external parties.

This guide is split into three sections:

*   handling data on MOJ ICT systems
*   information sharing
*   reporting data loss

[Data Movement Form](#dmf) includes a copy of the MoJ Data Movement Form (DMF). This form must be completed for all transfers where information is transferred from a MoJ ICT system to another MoJ ICT system or external party, further details on the form can be found in [Data Movement Form](#dmf).

**Note:** This document provides guidance for handling and sharing of information / data up to and including Impact Level (IL) 3 REST*. Where information attracts a high protective marking or IL, advice must be sought from the MoJ Operation Security Team (OST) and the MoJ Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

### Demonstration of Compliance

The [CESG Information Assurance Maturity Model (IAMM)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/information-assurance-maturity-model-and-assessment-framework-gpg-40) sets out the minimum maturity level Government departments should attain. Safeguarding data is captured as a basic requirement in Level 1 and the MoJ will need to demonstrate compliance against this requirement.

## Handling data on MoJ ICT systems

This section covers how data must be handled on MoJ ICT systems, this includes both:

*   data in transit
*   data at rest

For the purposes of this guide, the term sensitive data / information refers to data or information which attracts a Government Protective Marking of up to and including IL3 REST*, see [IT Security - Protective Marking Guide](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/information-classification-and-handling-policy/) for further details.

### Ownership of information

All MoJ information is assigned an individual who has overall responsibility for the various handling aspects including:

*   registration
*   labelling
*   storage
*   any transfers
*   setting a retention period

Deleting/destroying or returning data and media, and ensuring that any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual obligations are adhered to.

This individual is the Information Asset Owner (IAO), the IAO must ensure that information for which they are responsible for is appropriately handled and where there is a business requirement to share it with a 3rd party, that it is shared in a safe and secure manner.

### Electronic data transfer and storage

Data must be stored only on managed accredited networks, with transfers onto remote access laptops or other mobile devices/media minimised. No sensitive data should be stored solely on non-networked devices/media unless specifically approved by the IAO.

## Information sharing

### General principles

Where there is a business need to transfer sensitive data, it must be appropriately secured or encrypted using an approved mechanism prior to electronic transmission or export to removable media device such as a CD or USB memory stick.

Transferring sensitive data (with the appropriate security controls) may be achieved by:

*   transmission over a secure network that is accredited to carry such data, either in clear (where this has been approved by the system Accreditor and IAO) or encrypted
*   transmission over an unprotected network, employing encryption of sufficient strength to mitigate any communication security risks identified
*   physical transportation of storage media using encryption of sufficient strength to mitigate the security risks associated with the information being transferred in addition to the physical and procedural measures required to protect the media itself

**Note:** Only the minimum amount of sensitive data necessary to meet the business requirement should be transferred and not the entire data set.

The sender must ensure that any data shared can be adequately secured by the recipient. The sensitivity of data must never be downgraded in order to send it over inadequately protected channels or to send it to a recipient who does not have an appropriate facility to protect it after it arrives.
