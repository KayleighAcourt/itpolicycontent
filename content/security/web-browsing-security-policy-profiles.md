There are 5 different policy groups including a default for the Judiciary and a Standard Internet profile. A further 3 groups have been specifically set up to allow different access levels to the Internet depending on business need. An audit exercise has been undertaken by Operational Security to obtain business case approvals for any user requiring access to any group other than the Standard Internet profile and this has resulted in everyone being mapped to the appropriate group prior to the Trustwave implementation.

If you have not completed a business case form and had this approved, you will have been mapped to the Standard Internet group.

There are five policy profiles. The following table summarises the policy groups:

| User community | Web restriction policy group | Web mail permitted | Activity logged | Activity reported |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Judiciary](#judiciary) | No Restrictions in place | Y - By default | Y | N - By default Reporting is permitted by appropriate judicial sanction |
| [Unrestricted with web mail](#unrestrictedwithwebmail) | No Restrictions in place | Y - By default | Y | Y |
| [Unrestricted without web mail](#unrestrictedwithoutwebmail)  | Limited Restrictions in place | N | Y | Y |
| [Social networking](#socialnetworking) | Limited Restrictions in place | N | Y | Y |
| [All other users](#allotherusers) | Standard Internet profile | N | Y | Y |

Each profile identifies categories of content that are normally blocked. Content that is not in a blocked category will normally be available to a profile.
