## Why?

All MoJ staff (including contractors and agency staff) are entitled to be granted access to the information which is required for their work, subject to their level of clearance and employment status.

## User and Information Access management

Access control is primarily about enforcing three information security principles:

*   The **'need-to-know'** principle – restricting access to information based on a business requirement;
*   **Non-repudiation** of User actions –holding a User accountable for their actions on an ICT system; and,
*   The **'least privilege'** principle – assigning the least number of privileges required to fulfil their work. 

## User registration and account creation

The following activities must be undertaken for each new User registration:

*   The identity of the new User must be confirmed – for an MoJ member of staff this is confirmed by MoJ HR;
*   The access rights required must be supplied (for example, the list of RBAC groups and/or applications);
*   Confirmation of clearance level (see section 4.2.1.1 of Enterprise Policy for further details); and,
*   The application for User registration must be authorised by a MoJ senior manager – **Note:** This authorisation is used as confirmation of the Users identity and the access rights requested are correct.

## Review of user access rights

Access rights must be reviewed on a regular basis and may need to be updated as a result of any change in job role, security clearance, or employment status. IT System owner / Information Asset Owner responsibilities.

An IT System Owner or Information Asset Owner (IAO) is responsible for managing access control rules for their particular system.

## Account removal

An individuals User account and any associated access rights must be removed once that individual has either left the organisation or no longer requires access to the IT system (or application) that the account was created for.

Account removal must be authorised by MoJ HR. The leavers process can be found on the HR intranet page, see <https://myservices.justice.gov.uk/moj/my-services>.

## Audit

A 6 monthly independent review of User access rights is to be carried out.
