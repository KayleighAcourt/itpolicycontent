## Why?

All MoJ ICT systems are under the threat from malware based attacks which have the potential to:

*   Compromise the Confidentiality and/or Integrity of MoJ data (which includes sensitive personal data);
*   Disrupt the delivery of public service through compromising the Availability of MoJ ICT systems.

## What?

Departments and Agencies must put in place an appropriate range of technical controls for all ICT systems, proportionate to the value, importance and sensitivity of the information held and the requirements of any interconnected systems. 

Ensure that they take action to develop and keep up to date an appropriate understanding of new, emerging and changing threats and vulnerabilities and manage the risk of these threats and vulnerabilities.
