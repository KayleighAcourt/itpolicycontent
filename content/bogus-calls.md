There are a range of scams that can target you at home or at work. Callers say they are from IT Support and they may tell you that they have detected a virus on your machine that needs to be removed. The bogus caller will then either direct you to a website in the hope you will download malicious software or they will try and obtain details from you relating to your PC/laptop and the MoJ network.

In all genuine situations the MoJ service desk will be able to provide you with an incident reference number if there is a genuine problem with your machine.

If you receive a call from someone claiming to be from the service desk **always** ensure you ask them for the incident reference number. A genuine number will be 7 digits long.

We advise you to:

*   treat all unsolicited calls as suspicious
*   do not go to any external site if directed
*   do not give any information relating to your PC/laptop to the caller
*   check if the call is genuine with your IT Service desk and report it as a security incident if it is not (use a different phone from that used to take the original call)
*   try to note the telephone number of the caller (if possible).
