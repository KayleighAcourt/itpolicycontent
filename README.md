# Draft and Review versions of MoJ IT Policy content.

These documents are about MoJ policy regarding IT resources.
The documents are not anything to do with the functional aspects of MoJ work,
such as the judiciary, courts, Legal Aid, and so on.

Many aspects of MoJ IT Policy inherit from, or are guided by, higher or broader policy
statements, for example from the Cabinet Office.

**Note:** None of the content in this repository is necessarily complete or correct,
because it is intended for draft or review purpose.
